            Munich Airport in Germany was forced to close for almost seven hours overnight after a wave of drone sightings, the latest European aviation hub to shutter over unexplained drone flights.
    
            A total of 17 flights were grounded shortly after 10 p.m. local time on Thursday, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers, the airport said in a statement.
    
            In addition, 15 arriving flights were diverted to the German cities of Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Frankfurt, as well as Vienna in neighboring Austria, the statement said. Flight tracking website Flightradar showed several planes circling the airport at around 11pm local time before heading to other destinations.
    
            The airport reopened at 5 a.m local time when flight arrivals and departures were deemed safe, a call handler fielding passenger enquiries told CNN.
    
            “Now everything has resumed. Some flights were cancelled but the airport has reopened. Since 5 a.m, all arrivals and departures are safe,” they said.
    
            The first plane scheduled to land in Munich was a Lufthansa long haul flight from Bangkok, estimated to touch down at 5.25 a.m, according to the airport’s website.
    
            The airport in Bavaria, southern Germany, is a hub for German flag-carrier Lufthansa, and served nearly 20 million passengers in the first half of this year.
    
            A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN that 19 of its flights were cancelled or diverted due to the closure, including three long-haul flights to Asia which are set to be rescheduled.
    
            It had provided the affected passengers with food, drink and blankets, they said. Agency photos showed people sleeping on a row of camp beds.
    
            CNN has reached out to the Bavarian state police, Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office, and Germany’s domestic intelligence agency for comment.
    
            Munich becomes the latest European airport to close after sightings of drones nearby. A spate of sightings over several airports in Denmark last week saw tens of thousands of passengers impacted.
    
            Denmark later banned all civil drone flights in its airspace as it prepared to host a summit of European leaders in Copenhagen this week to discuss support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, and bolstering European security.
    
            At the summit leaders were expected to discuss several measures intended to protect the continent’s skies, including a flagship “drone wall” initiative.
    
            The drone wall initiative would not be a physical wall, but instead a layered network of detection and interception systems, building on individual EU members’ anti-drone capabilities.
    
            Europe has been on high alert in recent weeks due to a string of drone sightings, as well as alleged incursions by Russian drones into NATO airspace over Poland and Romania, and the alleged violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets.
    
            Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that while authorities cannot conclude who was behind the drone sightings in Denmark, “we can at least conclude that there is primarily one country that poses a threat to Europe’s security – and that is Russia.”
    
            The Kremlin has denied involvement in the drone sightings, as well as that it violated Estonian airspace.
    
            During a lengthy four hour televised event on Thursday, which touched on multiple key sticking points with Europe and the US, Putin scoffed at Western claims of possible Russian involvement in recent drone flights over Denmark, casting them as part of purported NATO efforts to “inflame tensions to boost the defense spending.”
    
            “I won’t anymore. Not to France, not to Denmark, not to Copenhagen,” he joked, in reference to the drone flight allegations.
    
            But he also issued a veiled threat.
    
            “We are carefully watching the growing militarization of Europe,” he said. “Is all of this just words or is it time for us to take countermeasures? No one should have doubt that Russia’s countermeasures will not take a long time to come.”
    
            Munich, a historic city of more than 1 million people, was already on edge after its famed Oktoberfest beer festival was closed for several hours earlier this week due to a bomb threat.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the United States that supplies of long-range missiles to Ukraine will seriously damage relations between Moscow and Washington but will not change the situation on the battlefield, where the Russian army is making slow but steady advances.
    
            The potential supply of US Tomahawk cruise missiles to Kyiv will signal a “qualitatively new stage of escalation, including in relations between Russia and the US,” Putin said at a forum of international foreign policy experts in Russia’s Black Sea resort of Sochi.
    
            The Russian leader noted that even though Tomahawk missiles will inflict damage on Russia if supplied to Ukraine, Russian air defenses will quickly adapt to the new threat. “It will certainly not change the balance of force on the battlefield,” he added, emphasizing that the Russian military is continuously making gains against Ukraine.
    
            Asked about Trump dismissing Russia as a “paper tiger” because of its failure to defeat its smaller neighbor after more than 3 1/2 years of fighting, Putin argued that Russia has faced all the NATO allies backing Kyiv.
    
            “We are fighting against the entire bloc of NATO and we keep moving, keep advancing and feel confident and we are a paper tiger; what NATO itself is?” he said. “A paper tiger? Go and deal with this paper tiger then.”
    
            The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Putin’s remarks.
    
            At the same time, Putin hailed US President Donald Trump’s efforts to help negotiate peace in Ukraine and described their August summit in Alaska as productive.
    
            “It was good that we made an attempt to search for and find possible ways to settle the Ukrainian crisis,” he said, adding that he felt “comfortable” talking to Trump.
    
            Putin also reaffirmed his offer to the US to extend their last remaining nuclear arms control pact for one more year after it expires in February. The 2010 New START treaty limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.
    
            “If they don’t need it, we don’t need it either,” he said, adding that “we feel confident about our nuclear shield.”
    
            While praising Trump and trying to emphasize potential common interests, the Russian president sent a stern warning to Ukraine’s Western allies against trying to seize ships that carry Russian oil to global markers. He argued that would amount to piracy and could trigger a forceful response while sharply destabilizing the global oil market.
    
            Threatening a forceful response to Western “piracy,” mocking drone claims
    
            Asked about the detention of an oil tanker off France’s Atlantic coast, which President Emmanuel Macron linked to Russia’s so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers of uncertain ownership that are avoiding Western sanctions, Putin cast it as an attempt by Macron to distract public attention from his country’s own internal problems and mockingly likened the French leader to Napoleon.
    
            He strongly warned the West against such action, arguing that it defies international maritime law and risks triggering military confrontation. “It’s piracy, and how do you deal with pirates? You destroy them,” he said.
    
            Putin also scoffed at Western claims of possible Russian involvement in recent drone flights over Denmark, casting them as part of purported NATO efforts to “inflame tensions to boost the defense spending.”
    
            Intrusions into NATO’s airspace blamed on Russia reached an unprecedented scale last month. A swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland, Estonia complained about an intrusion by Russian fighter jets and numerous unidentified drones were sighted over Denmark, Germany and other countries in what some European officials described as Moscow testing NATO’s response.
    
            European defense ministers have agreed to develop a “drone wall” along their borders to better detect, track and intercept drones violating Europe’s airspace.
    
            Putin dismissed Western allegations of Russia’s purported aggressive plans against NATO allies as “nonsense” aimed at distracting public attention from domestic problems.
    
            “We are carefully watching the growing militarization of Europe,” he said. “Is all of this just words or is it time for us to take countermeasures? No one should have doubt that Russia’s countermeasures will not take a long time to come.”
    
            Asked about Charlie Kirk’s assassination, Putin called it a “heinous crime” that reflected a “deep split” in American society. He hailed Kirk as a hero killed for promoting the same conservative values that Russia shares.
    
            Putin also praised Michael Gloss, an American and the son of a deputy CIA chief, who joined the Russian military and was killed in action in Ukraine in 2024. He said he had awarded Gloss with a medal, which he handed to Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff during his visit to Moscow.
    
            The Russian leader likened Gloss to Kirk, saying they championed similar “traditional” values. “He gave his life while defending those values as a Russian soldier, and Kirk gave his life while fighting for the same values in the United States,” Putin said.
    
            In response to questions about Gloss, the CIA said in a statement that the agency “considers Michael’s passing to be a private family matter — and not a national security issue. The entire CIA family is heartbroken for their loss.”
    
            At one point during the four-hour event televised live, Putin, a former Soviet KGB officer and one-time head of Russia’s top domestic security agency, misspoke and referred to himself as “the CIA director” while describing a meeting with President George W. Bush and his administration officials.
    
             “The future director,” Putin quipped as the audience broke into laughter.

As British Jews across the UK attended synagogue this morning for the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, many found out that there had been an attack outside a synagogue in Manchester. The horror filtered across the synagogue in whispers. It is a day of fasting, reflection and prayer, when Jewish people believe it is the day that sets how their year will go. The words used in one of the most significant prayers on this day: “on Yom Kippur it is sealed... who will live and who will die”. Today, terror came to British Jews at their synagogue, and many absolutely fear for their safety. Security is already mandatory for synagogues, Jewish schools and community centres, but it is unable to fully keep out the hate.Jewish people greet each other on Yom Kippur with a phrase in Hebrew "G’mar Chatima Tovah". It’s interpreted as "may you have a good and final sealing in the book of life".Two Jewish people in Britain lost their lives today and for the community here, some who over generations fled persecution to these shores, who always viewed Britain as a safe haven, but have been rocked by an increase in antisemitism, nothing will ever feel the same again.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Andrew Yang Weighs In on the NYC Mayoral Race, Shutdown</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtWmL7sLOy0</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JtWmL7sLOy0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 21:12:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Former US Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang discusses his views on the New York City mayoral race and the federal government shutdown.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is renewing a push for the US to change a decades-old phrase describing its stance on Taiwan independence, a concession that would be a major diplomatic win for Beijing.
China has asked the Trump administration to officially declare that it “opposes” Taiwan independence, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. 
The suggested wording is stronger than the Biden administration’s previous statement that US officials “do not support” the self-ruled island seeking formal independence, and would add to China’s campaign to isolate Taiwan on the world stage. The Wall Street Journal first reported the request. 
The Trump administration has not made a decision regarding the demand, and it’s one in a long list of asks from the Chinese side under consideration, according to a separate person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. A State Department fact sheet on US ties with Taiwan is currently unavailable on its website. 
Language defining the US relationship with Taiwan has long been a sensitive subject. In February, after the State Department abruptly removed from its website a phrase saying the US does “not support Taiwan independence,” Beijing swiftly urged Washington to “correct its wrongdoings.” Prior to that, the Biden administration removed the phrase in May 2022 but reinstated it after Chinese officials protested.
China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun reiterated Beijing’s position on Taiwan when asked Monday at a regular briefing in Beijing about the Chinese request. “Upholding the ‘one China principle’ absolutely entails opposing Taiwanese independence,” he said.

            French police have arrested the captain and first officer of a sanctioned tanker suspected of operating for Russia’s “shadow fleet,” after the navy boarded the vessel, authorities said on Thursday.
    
            “Thanks to our Navy commandos and to the crews of the French Navy who intervened this weekend on board a Russian shadow fleet tanker, currently anchored off Saint-Nazaire,” Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu wrote on X.
    
            “Their action contributed to the arrest of two members of its crew.”
    
            Brest Prosecutor Stephane Kellenberger, whose office is handling the investigation into the Boracay, said in a statement the two people in custody had identified themselves as the ship’s captain and its first officer.
    
            They are accused of failing to provide proof of the vessel’s nationality and failing to comply with orders, and their detention has been extended, he said.
    
            Although President Emmanuel Macron has welcomed the probe into the vessel, estimating that Russia’s “shadow fleet” contains 600 to 1,000 ships, French authorities have been tight-lipped about the investigation.
    
            The Boracay, which has been sanctioned by Britain and the European Union, left the Russian port of Primorsk on September 20, according to MarineTraffic data.
    
            It was approximately 50 nautical miles (90 km) south of Copenhagen, heading out of the Baltic Sea, when drone activity forced the closure of the city’s airport around 18:30 GMT on September 22, according to MarineTraffic’s data.
    
            It was also observed traveling south along Denmark’s western coast on the evening of September 24, when drones were reported flying north of Esbjerg and near several nearby airports.
    
            French and Danish authorities have declined to comment on whether the French probe is related to the drone incursions.
    
            The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had no information about the vessel but added that the Russian military had to act sometimes to restore order when foreign countries had taken what spokesman Dmitry Peskov described as “provocative actions.”

As British Jews across the UK attended synagogue this morning for the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, many found out that there had been an attack outside a synagogue in Manchester. The horror filtered across the synagogue in whispers. It is a day of fasting, reflection and prayer, when Jewish people believe it is the day that sets how their year will go. The words used in one of the most significant prayers on this day: “on Yom Kippur it is sealed... who will live and who will die”. Today, terror came to British Jews at their synagogue, and many absolutely fear for their safety. Security is already mandatory for synagogues, Jewish schools and community centres, but it is unable to fully keep out the hate.Jewish people greet each other on Yom Kippur with a phrase in Hebrew "G’mar Chatima Tovah". It’s interpreted as "may you have a good and final sealing in the book of life".Two Jewish people in Britain lost their lives today and for the community here, some who over generations fled persecution to these shores, who always viewed Britain as a safe haven, but have been rocked by an increase in antisemitism, nothing will ever feel the same again.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Russia Brazenly Tests NATO’s Air Defenses | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3W3qH-Wp44</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/G3W3qH-Wp44?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 14:00:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russian drones, jet fighters and other aircraft have increasingly intruded into NATO airspace.

Signal is considered one of the most secure messengers."If we were faced with the choice of either undermining the integrity of our encryption and our data protection guarantees or leaving Europe, we would unfortunately make the decision to leave the market," Meredith Whittaker told the German Press Agency (dpa). The data protection expert is President of the non-profit Signal Foundation in the USA, which develops Signal.The European Union has been discussing a law for three years that is intended to regulate the fight against depictions of child sexual abuse. The proposal for a corresponding regulation stipulates that messengers such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram and Threema should allow content to be checked before it is encrypted. To this end, the apps would have to include a control mechanism that can check all content."Not only the good guys have access to a backdoor"Whittaker said Signal would never undermine the integrity of its end-to-end encryption. "It guarantees the privacy of millions and millions of people around the world, often in life-threatening situations." This is why Signal rejects chat control. "It's unfortunate that politicians continue to fall prey to a kind of magical thinking that assumes you can create a backdoor that only the good guys can access."In the debate on chat control in the EU, the European Parliament had opposed such plans - with a broad majority across all political camps. In the Council of Member States, on the other hand, there was a majority in favor of chat control. However, without Germany and a few other countries, the plans could not be implemented here either. This could now change under the Danish Council Presidency.Unclear position of the German governmentIt will be important to see how Germany positions itself. The coalition agreement of the black-red federal government states: "We will combat discrimination in the digital space and protect fundamental digital rights. In principle, we will safeguard the confidentiality of private communication and anonymity online." However, the word "in principle" indicates that exceptions to this principle may be permitted. Critics fear that this will also make it possible to install backdoors in WhatsApp, Signal and co.Signal CEO Whittaker said that in the worst case scenario, they would work with partners and the community to see if they could find ways to circumvent these rules. Signal also did this when the app was blocked in Russia or Iran. "But ultimately, we would leave the market before we had to comply with dangerous laws like these."Warning about the AI agentsIn the interview with dpa, Whittaker also warned against the use of so-called AI agents, i.e. software robots with artificial intelligence that travel the internet on behalf of the user and independently take care of things such as booking a table in a restaurant or coordinating appointments with friends. "These AI agents require enormous access options and almost unlimited authorizations. This gives them access to important applications and services - from the calendar to the email account, the Signal app or the credit card."In order for apps such as Signal to be able to effectively defend themselves against spying, the manufacturers of the operating systems for computers and cell phones - i.e. Microsoft with Windows, Google with Android and Apple especially with iOS for the iPhone - now have a duty. They would have to set up an objection option against AI agents at developer level.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>French military intercepts Russian ship suspected of launching drones into European airspace, Guardian reports</title><link>https://kyivindependent.com/french-military-intercepts-russian-ship-suspected-of-launching-drones-into-european-airspace/</link><author>/u/AdSpecialist6598</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 13:20:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Editor's note: The story was updated with comments by French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu.The French military has boarded a so-called Russian "shadow fleet" vessel suspected of launching drones into European airspace, the Guardian reported Oct. 1.The ship was intercepted by the French Navy on Sept. 28 and diverted to the coast of Western France while investigations continue.French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu confirmed on Oct. 2 that French troops boarded the "shadow fleet" ship anchored off Saint-Nazaire as part of a state investigation. Two crew members were detained.Moscow uses the fleet of tankers to evade sanctions on Russian oil. The Kremlin is also using the fleet to "launch and control" Russian drones over European cities, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 28, citing intelligence reports.The suspected ship, known as the Boracay, has changed its name several times and departed from Primorsk near Russia's St. Petersburg on Sept. 20. The vessel was en route to India carrying 750,000 barrels of oil.The ship was spotted near Denmark a week prior under its former name, Pushpa, the Guardian reported.Unidentified drones prompted airport closures several times in Denmark last week. As investigations continue, Danish authorities have not ruled out that the drones may be Russian.An investigation of the Boracay is taking place following the crew's "failure to justify the nationality of the vessel" and "refusal to cooperate," French authorities said.In April, the ship was registered as the Kiwala, and in 2024, the vessel was known as the Varuna, the Guardian reported.Several other cargo ships have been suspected of launching the Russian drones, Danish media reported.In recent days, drones have also caused disruptions in several European countries, including Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands.In response to the airspace violations, Ukrainian military specialists have arrived in Denmark to take part in joint counter-drone exercises, officials said Sept. 29.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elon Musk’s SpaceX Took Money Directly From Chinese Investors, Company Insider Testifies</title><link>https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-spacex-china-investors-court-testimony</link><author>/u/Stup1dMan3000</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 12:55:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.Elon Musk’s SpaceX has taken money directly from Chinese investors, according to previously sealed testimony, raising new questions about foreign ownership interests in one of the United States’ most important military contractors.The recent testimony, coming from a SpaceX insider during a court case, marks the first time direct Chinese investment in the privately held company has been disclosed. While there is no prohibition on Chinese ownership in U.S. military contractors, such investment is heavily regulated and the issue is treated by the U.S. government as a significant national security concern.“They obviously have Chinese investors to be honest,” Iqbaljit Kahlon, a major SpaceX investor, said in a deposition last year, adding that some are “directly on the cap table.” “Cap table” refers to the company’s capitalization table, which lists its shareholders.Kahlon’s testimony does not reveal the scope of Chinese investment in SpaceX or the identities of the investors. Kahlon has long been close with the company’s leadership and runs his own firm that acts as a middleman for wealthy investors looking to buy shares of SpaceX.SpaceX keeps its full ownership structure secret. It was previously reported that some Chinese investors had bought indirect stakes in SpaceX, investing in middleman funds that in turn owned shares in the rocket company. The new testimony describes direct investments that suggest a closer relationship with SpaceX.SpaceX has thrived as it snaps up sensitive U.S. government contracts, from building spy satellites for the Pentagon to launching spacecraft for NASA. U.S. embassies and the White House have connected to the company’s Starlink internet service too. Musk’s roughly 42% stake in the company is worth an estimated $168 billion. If he owned nothing else, he’d be one of the 10 richest people in the world.National security law experts said federal officials would likely be deeply interested in understanding the direct Chinese investment in SpaceX. Whether there was cause for concern would depend on the details, they said, but the U.S. government has asserted that China has a systematic strategy of using investments in sensitive industries to conduct espionage.If the investors got access to nonpublic information about the company — say, details on its contracts or supply chain — it could be useful to Chinese intelligence, said Sarah Bauerle Danzman, an Indiana University professor who has worked for the State Department scrutinizing foreign investments. That “would create huge risks that, if realized, would have huge consequences for national security,” she said.SpaceX did not respond to questions for this story. Kahlon declined to comment.The new court records come from litigation in Delaware between Kahlon and another investor. The testimony was sealed until ProPublica, with the assistance of lawyers at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the law firm Shaw Keller, moved in the spring to make it public. SpaceX fought the effort, but a judge ruled that some of the records must be released. Kahlon’s testimony was publicly filed this week.Buying shares in SpaceX is much more difficult than buying a piece of a publicly traded company like Tesla or Microsoft. SpaceX has control over who can buy stakes in it, and the company’s investors fall into different categories. The most rarefied group is the direct investors, who actually own SpaceX shares. This group includes funds led by Kahlon, Peter Thiel and a handful of other venture capitalists with personal ties to Musk. Then there are the indirect investors, who effectively buy stakes in SpaceX through a middleman like Kahlon. (The indirect investors are actually buying into a fund run by the middleman, typically paying a hefty fee.) All previously known Chinese investors in SpaceX fell into the latter category.This year, ProPublica reported on an unusual feature of SpaceX’s approach to investment from China. According to testimony from the Delaware case, the company allows Chinese investors to buy stakes in SpaceX so long as the money is routed through the Cayman Islands or other offshore secrecy hubs. Companies only have to proactively report Chinese investments to the government in limited circumstances, and there aren’t hard and fast rules for how much is too much.After ProPublica’s report, House Democrats sent a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth raising alarms about the company’s “potential obfuscation.” “In light of the extreme sensitivity of SpaceX’s work for DoD and NASA, this lack of transparency raises serious questions,” they wrote. It’s unclear if any action was taken in response.Kahlon has turned his access to SpaceX stock into a lucrative business. His investor list reads like an atlas of the world. The investors’ names are redacted in the recently unsealed document, but their addresses span from Chile to Malaysia. One is in Russia. At least two are in mainland China. One is in Qatar. (In one email to SpaceX’s chief financial officer, Kahlon said a Los Angeles-based fund had money from the Qatari royal family and was already invested in SpaceX.)“You made a big fortune,” a China-based financier wrote to Kahlon four years ago. “Lol something like that. SpaceX has been the gift that keeps on giving,” Kahlon responded. “All thanks to you.”Kahlon first met with SpaceX when it was a fledgling startup, according to court records. SpaceX’s CFO, Bret Johnsen, who’s been there for 14 years, testified that Kahlon “has been with the company in one form or fashion longer than I have.” Johnsen also testified that SpaceX has no formal policy about accepting investments from countries deemed adversaries by the U.S. government. But he said he asks fund managers to “stay away from Russian, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean ownership interest” because that could make it “more challenging to win government contracts.”There are indications that by 2021, Kahlon was wary of raising funds from China. The U.S. government had grown increasingly concerned about Chinese investments in tech companies, and that June, Kahlon told an associate he was “being picky” with who he’d let buy into a new SpaceX opportunity. “Only people I want to have a relationship with long term. No one from mainland China,” Kahlon said.But as he raced to assemble a pool of investors, those concerns appeared to fade away. By November 2021, Kahlon was personally raising money from China to buy SpaceX stakes. He told a Shanghai-based company that if it invested with him, it would get quarterly updates on SpaceX’s business development, “visits to SpaceX, and the opportunities to interview with Space X’s CFO,” court records show.Do you have any information we should know about Elon Musk’s businesses?

He was granted British citizenship in 2006.Three people - two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s - have been arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.Al Shamie allegedly drove a car towards the gates of the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue and then began attacking people with a knife.He was stopped from getting inside by security staff and members of the congregation. Police shot him dead minutes later, fearing that he was wearing a suicide device.Three men remain in a serious condition in hospital. One suffered a stab wound, a second was hurt after being hit by the car, and the third has an injury possibly "sustained as officers stopped the attacker".Detectives were still at two locations linked to the arrests on last night: White House Avenue in Crumpsall, and Langley Crescent in Prestwich."The second he got out of the car, he started stabbing anyone near him," witness Chava Lewin said."He went for the security guard and tried to break into the synagogue."Police said it appeared al Shamie hadn't been flagged up via the Prevent anti-terror and de-radicalisation programme.The first calls were received at 9.31am and minutes later "Plato" was declared - the codeword used by emergency services for a "marauding terror attack".Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player'He's trying to press a button'Video showed police pointing guns at the attacker as another person lies bloodied and motionless near the synagogue's gates."He's trying to press a button," says the man filming. "Shoot him!"As the attacker tries to get to his feet, a single shot is heard. Police said he was killed seven minutes after the first emergency call.Bomb disposal experts later probed the body and a SAS helicopter flew nearby - but the object worn by the attacker was judged to be "not viable".Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerChief Constable Sir Stephen Watson said there were a lot of people inside the synagogue when the attacker struck."Thanks to the immediate bravery of security staff and the worshippers inside, as well as the fast response of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access," he said.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who returned early from a meeting in Denmark, said Britain must defeat rising anti-Jewish hate."I express my solidarity, but also my sadness that you still have to live with these fears," said Sir Keir."Nobody should have to do that. Nobody. And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community."Yom Kippur is the holiest day of the Jewish year.It is a solemn day of observance and atonement, and marks the peak of the High Holidays.It comes after Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, with both occasions bookmarking the Ten Days of Repentance.Jews observe Yom Kippur by prayer and fasting from sunset the day before to the sunset of the day itself. No work is permitted, and for some, the day is spent at a synagogue.The occasion falls on the 10th day of Tishrei - a Hebrew month between late September and early October.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood visited the area, and said the government would do "whatever is required to keep our Jewish community safe".Members of the Royal Family also reacted to the attack.Enable CookiesAllow Cookies OnceThe King said he and the Queen were "deeply shocked and saddened"."Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this appalling incident and we greatly appreciate the swift actions of the emergency services," said the monarch.The Prince and Princess of Wales said their thoughts were "with the victims and the families".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia Upgraded Missiles to Bypass Patriot.

			Russia, according to the , may have upgraded its ballistic missiles used in strikes on Ukraine so they can evade the Patriot air defense system. The paper cites Ukrainian and Western sources.
		
			The systems in question are the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile, with a declared range of up to 500 kilometers, and the Kinzhal aero-ballistic missile, capable of hitting targets up to 480 kilometers away.
		
			According to FT’s sources, the missiles initially follow a standard trajectory before abruptly veering off course, executing a steep dive or a series of maneuvers that make interception by Patriot defenses more difficult.
		
			The effectiveness of Ukraine’s air defenses has dropped sharply: while in August 37% of Russian ballistic missiles were intercepted, in September the figure fell to just 6%.
		
			The paper notes that in the summer of 2025 Russia struck at least four drone-production facilities in Kyiv and the surrounding region. Among the targets was a plant manufacturing Turkish Bayraktar drones. That strike, carried out on August 28, saw Russian missiles bypass Ukraine’s air defenses and also damage the buildings of the EU delegation and the British Council located nearby.

Dutch pilots have already taken part in several combat operations during this deployment, including one instance where weapons were used to shoot down Russian drones.Earlier, Poland’s military announced it had concluded air operations after eight Russian drones violated the country’s airspace overnight, prompting a coordinated response with NATO allies.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brexit was a disaster – now UK PM Starmer dares to admit it</title><link>https://inews.co.uk/opinion/brexit-disaster-now-starmer-dares-admit-it-3950827</link><author>/u/ByGollie</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 09:40:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If someone does something once, it might be an accident. If they do it twice, it suggests a habit. But if they do it three times, it’s a communication strategy.Keir Starmer said something rather noticeable in his conference speech. He mocked the politicians who’d told voters that “Brexit lies on the side of that bus, click here for your new country”. That made the ears prick up. It’s the first time in a very long time that the Prime Minister has spoken critically about Brexit.You know he opposes it. He’s a human rights lawyer from north London. But he is usually too straitjacketed by Labour’s electoral strategy to say so publicly. Perhaps it was an accident, then. A slip of the tongue. Perhaps he let his feelings out by mistake and would keep them better concealed in future. Then, moments later, he did it again. The “self-appointed champions of working people”, he said, “lied to this country, unleashed chaos and walked away after Brexit”.Oh. So it wasn’t an accident. It was a habit. Then in an interview with GB News – of all people – he went even further. When we were in the EU, Britain had a returns agreement with the European Union on asylum, he pointed out. Farage “told the country it will make no difference if we left – well, he was wrong about that”. The small boats were therefore “Farage Boats”.That makes it a communication strategy. You don’t do the same thing three times in 24 hours by accident. And that suggests something profound: that the view of Brexit as a failure is now settled. It has ossified into a national consensus, without us ever really realising it was happening. Even the Labour leadership, which is usually petrified of this issue, believes it can safely criticise it.During the Brexit wars, Remainers would ask themselves when people would realise it was a mistake. The moment stubbornly refused to arrive. The value of sterling collapsed. The EU comprehensively out-negotiated us. Our political system fell into chaos. Small businesses went bust. None of it seemed to move the dial.The truth is, people are terrible at owning up to their mistakes. They very rarely admit that they were wrong about something. Instead, they turn into mini-Stalins, expunging their historical record and replacing it with one in which they were always right. People have very poor memories, especially when it comes to their own errors.Take the Iraq War. Nowadays, everyone seems to have been against it. They always knew it would be a disaster. They’d always thought so.But this is not how it felt at the time. Back then, there was broad and animated support for the war. , , , ,  and all supported it. With a combined circulation of 9.4 million, they massively outweighed the three papers opposing the war – the , and  – which had a combined audience of 2.7 million.YouGov conducted 21 polls between March and December 2003, asking whether people supported the war. On average, 54 per cent of Brits thought it was right. Now, that figure has plummeted, with just 23 per cent of people thinking it was right.Fine, so people changed their minds. Well, not quite. That would have involved a degree of honest introspection most people are incapable of. Instead, they simply rearranged the past so that it reflected their newfound view.When YouGov asked people in 2015 what their opinions of war in Iraq were at the time, just 37 per cent said they supported military action, an astonishing drop from the figures at the time. The effect is even more dramatic in the US. At the time of the war, 63 per cent of people backed the invasion. But a few years later, just 38 per cent recalled doing so.Slowly but surely, the same thing seems to be happening with Brexit. There was no one central event, no great moment of epiphany in which the nation realised what an error the whole thing was. But slowly, like rising damp, a sense of disdain, mockery and disappointment has taken over. A settled view has developed, without drama or surprise, without anyone even really noticing that it’s happening.Who on earth could claim that Brexit has been a success? Who could name a single benefit it has provided? Who could look at the promises made before the referendum and treat them with anything but bitter laughter now we know how it turned out?People will find different ways of framing their box-fresh opposition. They’ll say politicians missed the opportunities, or we had bad leadership, or the EU sabotaged us. But the truth is, it was a failure because it was a bad idea. It’s no more complicated than that. Voters were convinced to support a project to give the political class a kicking. In fact, they simply damaged themselves and their livelihoods.None of that really matters anymore. What matters is that an anti-Brexit consensus helps us repair the damage.Labour is not about to commit to rejoining the EU. Of course not. But it is pursuing a plan for a really quite intimate relationship with it: regulatory alignment in many areas, deep co-operation on defence, and now the Chancellor is confidently promoting an extensive youth mobility scheme – something which the party was reticent about supporting just a few months ago.That’ll do for now. But as the consensus grows and Labour becomes more confident in criticising Brexit, the possibilities grow for the kinds of things we can demand in a few years’ time, perhaps in time for the next election. Single market membership, perhaps, or the customs union, or a bespoke arrangement like Switzerland has. Or perhaps even full-blown membership.Brexit was always a terrible mistake. But now, at least, people recognise it. And with that, things might just start to improve.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dutch F-35 shoots down Russian drone, displays kill marking</title><link>https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/dutch-f-35-shoots-down-russian-drone-displays-kill-marking/</link><author>/u/MGC91</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 08:37:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) F-35A has received a drone kill marking after shooting down a Russian drone during the September 9–10 incursion into Polish airspace.The incident, which saw around 23 drones cross from Belarus into Poland, triggered a NATO-wide Quick Reaction Alert and was described by Polish leaders as an “unprecedented case of an attack” on NATO territory.The engagement was carried out by an F-35A of the 313th Squadron, deployed to Poland as part of NATO’s enhanced air policing mission. The Dutch Ministry of Defence later released an image showing a white drone silhouette painted below the canopy rail of the aircraft, marking the first confirmed combat kill for a Dutch Lightning II.According to Polish officials, the drones entered Poland around 23:30 local time on 9 September, forcing the closure of Warsaw International, Warsaw Modlin, Rzeszów–Jasionka and Lublin airports. At least four drones were shot down, most by Dutch fighters. Analysts later identified several of the drones as Gerbera-type decoys, apparently designed to test allied defences and disrupt civil aviation.Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans, who visited the Dutch F-35 detachment in Poland days after the incident, praised the professionalism and teamwork involved. “Russia’s reckless aggression continues,” he said. “By stationing F-35s in Poland, the Netherlands is demonstrating its readiness with allies, because NATO’s eastern border is also our security border.” He highlighted not only the role of the pilots, but also the mechanics and ground crews, who ensured the jets were combat-ready.The deployment of Dutch F-35s to Poland began on 1 September and will run until December, with the aircraft tasked to protect NATO airspace and deter further Russian incursions. From December, the Netherlands will also reinforce the mission with Patriot surface-to-air missiles, NASAMS, and counter-drone systems, bolstering Poland’s role as a logistics hub for support to Ukraine.The September drone incursion marked one of the largest airspace violations by Russia since the start of its invasion of Ukraine. Poland invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty in response, warning allies that Russian and Belarusian military activity represented an escalating threat. In the days after the incident, Russia and Belarus staged large-scale joint exercises, while NATO launched Operation Eastern Sentry to strengthen its air defences across the eastern flank.For the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the kill marking underscores both the combat credibility of the F-35 and the country’s willingness to take an active role in Europe’s collective defence. The F-35A, with its advanced sensor fusion and stealth, is optimised for detecting and engaging drones that might evade older radar systems. Dutch officials stressed that its deployment has already proven vital in securing NATO’s skies against Russian provocations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Belgian Prime Minister De Wever: &quot;I am willing to use the frozen Russian assets (€185b frozen in Belgium), but I need legal certainty and solidarity from other EU Member States to share the risks involved&quot;.</title><link>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/liveblog/premier-de-wever-over-bevroren-russisch-geld-we-zijn-bereid-om~1758694365422/</link><author>/u/BelgianPolitics</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 08:26:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Het was een heel zware nacht in Kiev", zegt Vlaming Barend Leyts, in het verleden nog journalist en woordvoerder van premier De Croo, die momenteel in de Oekraïense hoofdstad is als vrijwilliger voor een hulporganisatie.
