Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by registering expired or unregistered domains that were previously owned by legitimate entities.

But: How can security researchers and penetration testers efficiently identify these dead domains?

Some time ago, I stumbled over Süleyman Çelikarslan’s (@slymn\_clkrsln) tweets about second order domain takeover vulnerabilities. This inspired me to create two tools that can help identify dead domains:

Both tools aim to assist security researchers and penetration testers in discovering expired or unregistered domains _on the fly_. After achieving good results with the Chrome extension, I noticed that the “right” place to catch dead domains would probably be at the DNS level. Hence, I developed the UDP DNS forwarder.

## Dead Domain Discovery - Chrome Extension

The Chromium extensions aims to identify abandoned domains that are referenced by a website for instance within an iFrame, as script or as CSS source. The extension adds a small content script to each visited page that scans for such references using a call to dns.google.com. If a domain appears to be unregistered or expired, a notification is shown to the user using Chrome’s notification API. The extension uses manifest version 3 and is open source.

The recommended path for installation is via the Chrome Web Store.

Alternatively, you can also install the extension manually by following the instructions in the GitHub repository.

## Dead Domain Discovery DNS - DNS Forwarder

The Dead Domain Discovery DNS tool is a lightweight UDP DNS forwarder that highlights potentially expired or unregistered domains by watching for unanswered lookups. The server retries queries against secondary upstream resolvers, keeps a cooldown window to avoid noisy alerts, and reports findings through multiple channels.

The tool is built in Python makes use of the dnslib library for DNS packet handling. It can be easily integrated into existing penetration testing setups or used as a standalone service. I use it as my primary DNS server in my home setup to catch dead domains while browsing the web or performing security assessments. It is leightweight and efficient, making it suitable for continuous monitoring. I would recommend to run it on a Raspberry Pi or similar low-power devices.

You can find the repository and installation instructions on GitHub.

 Nov. 1, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 30 minutes ago
The RESTful Content Syndication plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ingest_image() function in versions 1.1.0 to 1.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This requires the attacker have access to a defined third-party server as specified in the settings, so it is unlikely that this will be exploitable by contributor-level users, and more likely to be exploited by administrators who also have access to the plugin's settings.

The System Profile feature is an administrative diagnostic/configuration capability. Due to improper access controls and unsafe handling of exported/imported profile data and operations, an authenticated administrator could exploit this vulnerability to execute actions on the underlying XI host outside the application's security scope. Successful exploitation may allow an administrator to obtain root privileges on the XI server.

Nagios XI versions prior to 2024R1.4.2 contain a remote code execution vulnerability in the Business Process Intelligence (BPI) component. Insufficient validation and sanitization of administrator-controlled BPI configuration parameters (notably bpi_logfile and bpi_configfile) allow an authenticated administrative user to cause the product to create or overwrite files within the webroot and subsequently edit them via the BPI configuration editor. When such files carry executable extensions and are served by the web application, arbitrary code may be executed in the context of the web application user. Successful exploitation results in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the Nagios XI web application user and can be leveraged to gain further control of the underlying host operating system.

CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prier to 1.4.2, there is a missing bounds check in Crypto_Key_update() (crypto_key_mgmt.c) which allows a remote attacker to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow by supplying a TLV packet with a spoofed length field. The function calculates the number of keys from an attacker-controlled field (pdu_len), which may exceed the static array size (kblk[98]), leading to an out-of-bounds write and potential memory corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.2.

The keras.utils.get_file API in Keras, when used with the extract=True option for tar archives, is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The utility uses Python's tarfile.extractall function without the filter="data" feature. A remote attacker can craft a malicious tar archive containing special symlinks, which, when extracted, allows them to write arbitrary files to any location on the filesystem outside of the intended destination folder. This vulnerability is linked to the underlying Python tarfile weakness, identified as CVE-2025-4517. Note that upgrading Python to one of the versions that fix CVE-2025-4517 (e.g. Python 3.13.4) is not enough.

JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security audit system. In JumpServer versions prior to v3.10.20-lts and v4.10.11-lts, an authenticated, non-privileged user can retrieve connection tokens belonging to other users via the super-connection API endpoint (/api/v1/authentication/super-connection-token/). When accessed from a web browser, this endpoint returns connection tokens created by all users instead of restricting results to tokens owned by or authorized for the requester. An attacker who obtains these tokens can use them to initiate connections to managed assets on behalf of the original token owners, resulting in unauthorized access and privilege escalation across sensitive systems. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.20-lts and v4.10.11-lts.

A vulnerability was identified in NeuVector, where the enforcer used environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT to generate a command to be executed via popen, without first sanitising their values.


The entry process of the enforcer container is the monitor
 process. When the enforcer container stops, the monitor process checks 
whether the consul subprocess has exited. To perform this check, the 
monitor process uses the popen function to execute a shell command that determines whether the ports used by the consul subprocess are still active.


The values of environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT
 are used directly to compose shell commands via popen without 
validation or sanitization.  This behavior could allow a malicious user 
to inject malicious commands through these variables within the enforcer
 container.
