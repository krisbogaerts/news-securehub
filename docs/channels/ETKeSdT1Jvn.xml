Can God and the enormity of evil both exist? To theists, it’s the problem of evil, which they struggle to resolve. To atheists, it’s the argument from evil, which they wield like a sword. Theists try to absolve God by differentiating ‘God allowing evil’ from ‘God creating evil’. But if God is all-powerful and all-knowing, how could God not have created evil?

Evaluating Materialism theories, like seeking neural correlates of consciousness, use the scientific method. But what about theories that are not Materialism?

A critical frontier in this evolution is the on-device AI agent, enabling sophisticated, AI-native experiences directly on mobile and embedded devices. While cloud-based AI faces challenges like constant connectivity demands, increased latency, privacy risks, and high operational costs, on-device breaks through these trade-offs.We'll delve into the practical side of building and deploying AI agents with “DeliteAI”, an open-source on-device AI agentic framework. We'll explore how lightweight Python runtimes facilitate the seamless orchestration of end-to-end workflows directly on devices, allowing AI/ML teams to define data preprocessing, feature computation, model execution, and post-processing logic independently of frontend code. This architecture empowers agents to adapt to varying tasks and user contexts through an ecosystem of tools natively supported on Android/iOS platforms, handling all the permissions, model lifecycles, and many more.Varun is the Founder and CEO of NimbleEdge, an AI startup pioneering privacy-first, on-device intelligence. With an academic foundation in AI and neuroscience from UC Berkeley, MPI Frankfurt, and IIT Kanpur, Varun brings deep expertise at the intersection of technology and science. Before founding NimbleEdge, Varun led open-source projects at OpenMined, focusing on privacy-aware AI, and published research in computer vision.Neeraj Poddar is the Co-founder and CTO at NimbleEdge. Prior to NimbleEdge, he was the Co-founder of Aspen Mesh, VP of Engineering at Solo.io, and led the Istio open source community. He has worked on various aspects of AI, networking, security, and distributed systems over the span of his career. Neeraj focuses on the application of open source technologies across different industries in terms of scalability and security. When not working on AI, you can find him playing racquetball and gaining back the calories spent playing by trying out new restaurants. ~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~[00:00] On-device AI skepticism[02:47] Word suggestion for AI[06:40] Optimizing unique challenges[13:39] LLM on-device challenges[20:34] Agent overlord tension[23:56] AI app constraints[29:23] Siri limitations and trust gap[32:01] Voice-driven app privacy[35:49] Platform lock-in vs aggregation[42:26] On-device AI optimizations]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stephen Wolfram on The Concept of the Ruliad | Closer To Truth Chats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6es7clgAaJ4</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6es7clgAaJ4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Make a donation to help Closer To Truth continue exploring the world's deepest questions without the need for paywalls: https://closertotruth.com/donate/

In OpenShift, the default container datapath is implemented using veth pairs connected to an OVS bridge, relying on kernel-space networking. With the introduction of DPDK and VDUSE (vDPA devices in userspace), OpenShift now not only offers a userspace datapath solution for container networking, but also unlocks the benefits of DPDK to containerized workloads—similar to the vhost-user solution used in traditional virtualized environments.
But what are the actual performance characteristics of the userspace datapath in OpenShift? And how does it compare to the kernel-space datapath?
In this talk, we will first present the technical architecture of the VDUSE OVS-DPDK userspace datapath solution we are implementing in OpenShift. We will then answer these questions by showcasing real-world benchmark results, focusing on key metrics such as latency, throughput, packets per second (PPS), among others.

In an increasingly hostile digital world, adopting Zero Trust security models has become a critical necessity for applications to be successful and secure. However, the complexity of implementing and monitoring a Zero Trust Architecture presents a significant challenge: how can non-security experts gain a clear and accurate understanding of their org's security compliance? 

The reality is that the detailed data from security assessments, often standardized but dense formats like the Open Security Control Assessment Language (OSCAL), is largely impenetrable to those without deep technical knowledge. Misunderstanding of this compliance status can lead to misinformed decisions and a false sense of security.

In this talk, you will be introduced to a visualization tool to address this problem. By transforming complex OSCAL assessment results into intuitive, interactive, and digestible visuals, this tool bridges the gap between complex technical data and product insight.

In 2024, inspired by the Mass Open Cloud (MOC), and in collaboration with the MOC Alliance (MOC-A), Red Hat Waterford and the Walton Institute at SETU collaborated and partnered in establishing an experimental cloud for researchers, staff and students in both organisations. These are the first steps in extending the MOC-A into Europe. Already, this private/public sector collaboration has created a community of new OpenShift and RHEL users with bare metal access. It has unblocked our work with partners on multiple Horizon EU projects. It has been made possible by recycling a super computer, installed in the liquid cooled Walton data centre, with operations provided by SETU, tech support for the ops team provided by Red Hat, and initial testing by the RH-OCTO team in Waterford. Positive interest around the project has attracted additional infrastructure in the form of storage funded by SETU, and an IBM Z LinuxONE mainframe. 

Do you need access to multiple multi node clusters on OpenShift AI on RHEL? 
Do you need access to OpenShift on OpenStack?

As the online world continues to evolve, the intersection of Web3 and container solutions is creating a new era of decentralized cloud infrastructure. With their portability, scalability, and efficiency, containers are becoming the building blocks of choice for deploying and operating decentralized applications (dApps) and distributed computing environments in the Web3 world. By virtualizing infrastructure and offering uniform runtime environments, containers allow developers to build, deploy, and manage services across geographically dispersed nodes—a basic ability for decentralized systems.
There is a new trend here that comes with new and difficult security implications. Traditional security models depend on central control and fixed boundaries, which are not easily applicable to decentralized settings. In Web3 environments, where control, execution, and data are distributed, trust and integrity are much harder to ensure. Containers in such contexts introduce new kinds of threats, such as vulnerabilities in base images, insecure communication between nodes, and the threat of tainted containers impacting a bigger network of services.
This session will explain how containers are fueling the decentralized cloud in Web3, both its potential and risk involved in its security. It will also examine ways to address the risks, including cryptographic identity, zero-trust networking, secure orchestration, and immutable infrastructure. Everyone in attendance will learn about the best ways to protect, grow, containerized solutions in a very decentralized world and how to address the evolving threat landscape coming their way before it gets the better of them.

Real-time computing has a strict rule: correctness means producing the right output within a non-negotiable deadline. General-purpose OSes with their unbounded delays can't make this promise, which is why we rely on systems like the PREEMPT_RT kernel. Before this work, however, critical questions were left to guesswork: ""Have we tested long enough?"" and ""How do we know an even worse latency won't happen in production?""

This talk presents a toolkit that methodically answers these questions by applying Extreme Value Theory (EVT). Just as the Central Limit Theorem describes the behavior of averages, EVT provides the powerful statistical foundation for predicting extreme maximums. We'll show how this tool forecasts performance limits, helps diagnose deep-seated system bugs, and provides immense business value by turning uncertainty into data-backed confidence, enabling robust SLAs and de-risking system deployment.

In this talk, we’ll explore in detail about Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Arbitrary Command Execution attacks by diving into real-world vulnerabilities. I intend to explain how attackers exploit popular open source libraries through specific CVEs.

Vulnerabilities that we will look into: (See notes for detailed explanation)

- CVE-2024-47076: cups-filters: 
A vulnerability in CUPS allows attackers to exploit a flaw in how it processes print requests. By sending a malformed request, an attacker can trigger a memory issue, potentially leading to the attacker taking control of the system. 

- CVE-2024-6345: python-setuptools: 
Attackers can leverage weaknesses in the package_index module to run arbitrary code during package downloads, potentially compromising entire Python build environments. 

- CVE-2024-32002: git:
A vulnerability enables code execution during the cloning of local repositories, posing a risk to version control workflows.

This session includes a live demo showcasing an attack scenario in a controlled environment, providing attendees with practical insights into exploit execution.

Agile. Many engineers cringe at the word, associating it with overhead, planning, and formality—seemingly at odds with the flexibility needed to solve complex problems.

But what if I told you that you were actually born agile? I'm sure you’ll hate me, but stick around, and you might see I’m not that far off.

Agile isn’t just a business methodology; it mirrors how we naturally grow and learn. We start life without a plan, learning through trial, error, and support—just like our careers and projects. We iterate, refine, and adapt rather than having everything figured out from the start.

So why do engineers resist agile if it’s so innate? This talk explores that tension, uncovering how the same mentorship, collaboration, and continuous learning you grew up with can help teams move past frustration and fully embrace agility.

Many people believe that out-of-the-body experiences (OBEs) and near-death experiences (NDEs) are real. We do not assess the evidence and arguments, pro or con. We do explore what OBEs and NDEs would mean, if real, for theories of consciousness.

In his book "What Is Intelligence?" and in this conversation, Google's Blaise Agüera y Arcas takes up the idea that prediction is fundamental not only to intelligence and the brain but to life itself, and explores the wide-ranging implications. These include radical new perspectives on the computational properties of living systems, the evolutionary and social origins of intelligence, the relationship between models and reality, entropy and the nature of time, the meaning of free will, the problem of consciousness, and the ethics of machine intelligence.

If God is perfect, does this mean that God cannot change? Since perfection cannot be improved, would any change diminish God’s perfection? But a changeless God has problems, such as relating to humans in sequence and not progressing. God is more complex than we can imagine, but trying to relate God’s changelessness to God’s perfection probes God’s essence.
