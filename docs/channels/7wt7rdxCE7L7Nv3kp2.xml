Or, as the defender, applying patches or mitigations the fastest.And if you’re on the inside you know what the applications do. You know what’s important and what isn’t. And you can use all that internal knowledge to fix things­—hopefully before the baddies take advantage.Attackers will have the advantage for 3-5 years. For less-advanced defender teams, this will take much longer.
After that point, AI/SPQA will have the additional internal context to give Defenders the advantage.LLM tech is nowhere near ready to handle the context of an entire company right now. That’s why this will take 3-5 years for true AI-enabled Blue to become a thing.And in the meantime, Red will be able to use publicly-available context from OSINT, Recon, etc. to power their attacks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HackerOne paid $81 million in bug bounties over the past year</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackerone-paid-81-million-in-bug-bounties-over-the-past-year/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 15:35:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bug bounty platform HackerOne announced that it paid out $81 million in rewards to white-hat hackers worldwide over the past 12 months.
