AI’s global democratic impact is already profound.</h3><p>It’s been just a few years since ChatGPT stormed into view and AI’s influence has already permeated every democratic process in governments around the world:</p><ul><li>In 2022, an artist collective in Denmark founded the world’s first political party committed to an AI-generated policy platform.</li><li>Also in 2022, South Korean politicians running for the presidency were the first to use AI avatars to communicate with voters en masse.</li><li>In 2023, a Brazilian municipal legislator passed the first enacted law written by AI.</li><li>In 2024, a U.S. federal court judge started using AI to interpret the plain meaning of words in U.S. law.</li><li>Also in 2024, the Biden administration disclosed more than two thousand discrete use cases for AI across the agencies of the U.S. federal government.</li></ul><p>The examples illustrate the diverse uses of AI across citizenship, politics, legislation, the judiciary, and executive administration.</p><p>Not all of these uses will create lasting change. Some of these will be one-offs. Some are inherently small in scale. Some were publicity stunts. But each use case speaks to a shifting balance of supply and demand that AI will increasingly mediate.</p><p>Legislators need assistance drafting bills and have limited staff resources, especially at the local and state level. Historically, they have looked to lobbyists and interest groups for help. Increasingly, it’s just as easy for them to use an AI tool.</p><h3>2. The first places AI will be used are where there is the least public oversight.</h3><p>Many of the use cases for AI in governance and politics have vocal objectors. Some make us uncomfortable, especially in the hands of authoritarians or ideological extremists.</p><p>In some cases, politics will be a regulating force to prevent dangerous uses of AI. Massachusetts has banned the use of AI face recognition in law enforcement because of real concerns voiced by the public about their tendency to encode systems of racial bias.</p><p>Some of the uses we think might be most impactful are unlikely to be adopted fast because of legitimate concern about their potential to make mistakes, introduce bias, or subvert human agency. AIs could be assistive tools for citizens, acting as their voting proxies to help us weigh in on larger numbers of more complex ballot initiatives, but we know that many will object to anything that verges on AIs being given a vote.</p><p>But AI will continue to be rapidly adopted in some aspects of democracy, regardless of how the public feels. People within democracies, even those in government jobs, often have great independence. They don’t have to ask anyone if it’s ok to use AI, and they will use it if they see that it benefits them. The Brazilian city councilor who used AI to draft a bill did not ask for anyone’s permission. The U.S. federal judge who used AI to help him interpret law did not have to check with anyone first. And the Trump administration seems to be using AI for everything from drafting tariff policies to writing public health reports—with some obvious drawbacks.</p><p>It’s likely that even the thousands of disclosed AI uses in government are only the tip of the iceberg. These are just the applications that governments have seen fit to share; the ones they think are the best vetted, most likely to persist, or maybe the least controversial to disclose.</p><h3>3. Elites and authoritarians will use AI to concentrate power.</h3><p>Many Westerners point to China as a cautionary tale of how AI could empower autocracy, but the reality is that AI provides structural advantages to entrenched power in democratic governments, too. The nature of automation is that it gives those at the top of a power structure more control over the actions taken at its lower levels.</p><p>It’s famously hard for newly elected leaders to exert their will over the many layers of human bureaucracies. The civil service is large, unwieldy, and messy. But it’s trivial for an executive to change the parameters and instructions of an AI model being used to automate the systems of government.</p><p>The dynamic of AI effectuating concentration of power extends beyond government agencies. Over the past five years, Ohio has undertaken a project to do a wholesale revision of its administrative code using AI. The leaders of that project framed it in terms of efficiency and good governance: deleting millions of words of outdated, unnecessary, or redundant language. The same technology could be applied to advance more ideological ends, like purging all statutory language that places burdens on business, neglects to hold businesses accountable, protects some class of people, or fails to protect others.</p><p>Whether you like or despise automating the enactment of those policies will depend on whether you stand with or are opposed to those in power, and that’s the point. AI gives any faction with power the potential to exert more control over the levers of government.</p><h3>4. Organizers will find ways to use AI to distribute power instead.</h3><p>We don’t have to resign ourselves to a world where AI makes the rich richer and the elite more powerful. This is a technology that can also be wielded by outsiders to help level the playing field.</p><p>In politics, AI gives upstart and local candidates access to skills and the ability to do work on a scale that used to only be available to well-funded campaigns. In the 2024 cycle, Congressional candidates running against incumbents like Glenn Cook in Georgia and Shamaine Daniels in Pennsylvania used AI to help themselves be everywhere all at once. They used AI to make personalized robocalls to voters, write frequent blog posts, and even generate podcasts in the candidate’s voice. In Japan, a candidate for Governor of Tokyo used an AI avatar to respond to more than eight thousand online questions from voters.</p><p>Outside of public politics, labor organizers are also leveraging AI to build power. The Worker’s Lab is a U.S. nonprofit developing assistive technologies for labor unions, like AI-enabled apps that help service workers report workplace safety violations. The 2023 Writers’ Guild of America strike serves as a blueprint for organizers. They won concessions from Hollywood studios that protect their members against being displaced by AI while also winning them guarantees for being able to use AI as assistive tools to their own benefit.</p><h3>5. The ultimate democratic impact of AI depends on us.</h3><p>If you are excited about AI and see the potential for it to make life, and maybe even democracy, better around the world, recognize that there are a lot of people who don’t feel the same way.</p><p>If you are disturbed about the ways you see AI being used and worried about the future that leads to, recognize that the trajectory we’re on now is not the only one available.</p><p>The technology of AI itself does not pose an inherent threat to citizens, workers, and the public interest. Like other democratic technologies—voting processes, legislative districts, judicial review—its impacts will depend on how it’s developed, who controls it, and how it’s used.</p><p>Constituents of democracies should do four things:</p><ul><li> the technology ecosystem to be more trustworthy, so that AI is developed with more transparency, more guardrails around exploitative use of data, and public oversight.</li><li> inappropriate uses of AI in government and politics, like facial recognition technologies that automate surveillance and encode inequity.</li><li> AI in government where it can help improve outcomes, like making government more accessible to people through translation and speeding up administrative decision processes.</li><li> the systems of government vulnerable to the disruptive potential of AI’s superhuman capabilities, like political advertising rules that never anticipated deepfakes.</li></ul><p>These four Rs are how we can rewire our democracy in a way that applies AI to truly benefit the public interest.</p>","contentLength":8404,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Australië waarschuwt voor Cisco-routers besmet met Badcandy-malware","url":"https://www.security.nl/posting/911296/Australi%C3%AB+waarschuwt+voor+Cisco-routers+besmet+met+Badcandy-malware?channel=rss","date":1761908520,"author":"","guid":3679,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\n            De Australische overheid waarschuwt organisaties voor routers en switches van Cisco die met de \"Badcandy\" malware besmet zijn.

In the last 12 months, fraudsters have used advanced AI tools to create more convincing schemes, resulting in over $400 billion in stolen funds globally.<p>\nFor years, Android has been on the frontlines in the battle against scammers, using the best of Google AI to build proactive, multi-layered protections that can anticipate and block scams before they reach you. Android’s scam defenses protect users around the world from over 10 billion suspected malicious calls and messages every month. In addition, Google continuously performs safety checks to maintain the integrity of the RCS service. In the past month alone, this ongoing process blocked over 100 million suspicious numbers from using RCS, stopping potential scams before they could even be sent. \n</p><p>\nTo show how our scam protections work in the real world, we asked users and independent security experts to compare how well Android and iOS protect you from these threats. We're also releasing a new <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/android_2025_text_based_scams_report.pdf\">report</a> that explains how modern text scams are orchestrated, helping you understand the tactics fraudsters use and how to spot them. \n</p><p><strong>Survey shows Android users’ confidence in scam protections</strong></p><p>\nGoogle and YouGov surveyed 5,000 smartphone users across the U.S., India, and Brazil about their experiences. The findings were clear: Android users reported receiving fewer scam texts and felt more confident that their device was keeping them safe.\n</p><ul><li>Android users were 58% more likely than iOS users to say they had not received any scam texts in the week prior to the survey. The advantage was even stronger on Pixel, where users were 96% more likely than iPhone owners to report zero scam texts.</li><li>At the other end of the spectrum, iOS users were 65% more likely than Android users to report receiving three or more scam texts in a week. The difference became even more pronounced when comparing iPhone to Pixel, with iPhone users 136% more likely to say they had received a heavy volume of scam messages.</li><li>Android users were 20% more likely than iOS users to describe their device’s scam protections as “very effective” or “extremely effective.” When comparing Pixel to iPhone, iPhone users were 150% more likely to say their device was not effective at all in stopping mobile fraud.</li></ul><p><em>YouGov study findings on users’ experience with scams on Android and iOS</em></p><strong>Security researchers and analysts highlight Android’s AI-driven safeguards against sophisticated scams</strong><p>\nIn a recent <a href=\"https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/assessing-the-state-of-ai-powered-mobile-security-blog\">evaluation</a> by Counterpoint Research, a global technology market research firm, Android smartphones were found to have the most AI-powered protections. The independent study compared the latest Pixel, Samsung, Motorola, and iPhone devices, and found that Android provides comprehensive AI-driven safeguards across ten key protection areas, including email protections, browsing protections, and on-device behavioral protections. By contrast, iOS offered AI-powered protections in only two categories. You can see the full comparison in the visual below.\n</p><em>Counterpoint Research comparison of Android and iOS AI-powered protections</em><p>\nCybersecurity firm Leviathan Security Group conducted a funded <a href=\"https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/october-2025-mobile-platform-security-amp-fraud-prevention-assessment\">evaluation</a> of scam and fraud protection on the iPhone 17, Moto Razr+ 2025, Pixel 10 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. Their analysis found that Android smartphones, led by the Pixel 10 Pro, provide the highest level of default scam and fraud protection.The report particularly noted Android's robust call screening, scam detection, and real-time scam warning authentication capabilities as key differentiators. Taken together, these independent expert assessments conclude that Android’s AI-driven safeguards provide more comprehensive and intelligent protection against mobile scams.\n</p><em>Leviathan Security Group comparison of scam protections across various devices</em><p><strong>Why Android users see fewer scams</strong></p><p>\nAndroid’s proactive protections work across the platform to help you stay ahead of threats with the best of Google AI. \n</p><ul><li><strong>Keeping your messages safe: </strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging\">Google Messages</a> automatically filters known spam by analyzing sender reputation and message content, moving suspicious texts directly to your \"spam &amp; blocked\" folder to keep them out of sight. For more complex threats, Scam Detection uses on-device AI to analyze messages from unknown senders for patterns of conversational scams (like pig butchering) and provide real-time warnings.  This helps secure your privacy while providing a robust shield against text scams. As an extra safeguard, Google Messages also helps block suspicious links in messages that are determined to be spam or scams.</li><li><strong>Combatting phone call scams:</strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.dialer\">Phone by Google</a> automatically blocks known spam calls so your phone never even rings, while Call Screen can answer the call on your behalf to identify fraudsters. If you answer, the protection continues with Scam Detection, which uses on-device AI to provide real-time warnings for suspicious conversational patterns. This processing is completely ephemeral, meaning no call content is ever saved or leaves your device. Android also helps stop social engineering during the call itself by blocking high-risk actionslike installing untrusted apps or disabling security settings, and warns you if your screen is being shared unknowingly.</li></ul><p>\nThese safeguards are built directly into the core of Android, alongside other features like real-time app scanning in <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=en\">Google Play Protect</a> and enhanced <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9890866?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid\">Safe Browsing</a> in Chrome using LLMs. With Android, you can trust that you have intelligent, multi-layered protection against scams working for you.\n</p><p><strong>Android is always evolving to keep you one step ahead of scams</strong></p><p>\nIn a world of evolving digital threats, you deserve to feel confident that your phone is keeping you safe. That’s why we use the best of Google AI to build intelligent protections that are always improving and work for you around the clock, so you can connect, browse, and communicate with peace of mind. \n</p><p><em>2: This total comprises all instances where a message or call was proactively blocked or where a user was alerted to potential spam or scam activity. <a href=\"http://security.googleblog.com/2025/10/how-android-protects-you-from-scams.html#fnref2\">↩</a></em></p><p><em>3: Google/YouGov survey, July-August 2025; n=5,100 across US, IN, BR <a href=\"http://security.googleblog.com/2025/10/how-android-protects-you-from-scams.html#fnref3\">↩</a></em></p><p><em>4: Google/Counterpoint Research, “Assessing the State of AI-Powered Mobile Security”, Oct. 2025; based on comparing the Pixel 10 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, OnePlus 13, Motorola Razr+ 2025.

The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability.</p><p>Details of that original test are <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu8578\">being made available today</a> as part of a much larger analysis that extends the approach to a large range of toxic proteins. Starting with 72 toxins, the researchers used three open source AI packages to generate a total of about 75,000 potential protein variants.</p><p>And this is where things get a little complicated. Many of the AI-designed protein variants are going to end up being non-functional, either subtly or catastrophically failing to fold up into the correct configuration to create an active toxin.</p><p>In any case, DNA sequences encoding all 75,000 designs were fed into the software that screens DNA orders for potential threats. One thing that was very clear is that there were huge variations in the ability of the four screening programs to flag these variant designs as threatening. Two of them seemed to do a pretty good job, one was mixed, and another let most of them through. Three of the software packages were updated in response to this performance, which significantly improved their ability to pick out variants.</p><p>There was also a clear trend in all four screening packages: The closer the variant was to the original structurally, the more likely the package (both before and after the patches) was to be able to flag it as a threat. In all cases, there was also a cluster of variant designs that were unlikely to fold into a similar structure, and these generally weren’t flagged as threats.</p></blockquote><p>The research is all preliminary, and there are a lot of ways in which the experiment diverges from reality. But I am not optimistic about this particular arms race. I think that the ability of AI systems to create something deadly will advance faster than the ability of AI systems to detect its components.</p>","contentLength":2273,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Vulnerability in OpenSolution Quick.Cart software","url":"https://cert.pl/en/posts/2025/10/CVE-2025-10317/","date":1761821700,"author":"","guid":3543,"unread":true,"content":"<h3>Vulnerability in OpenSolution Quick.Cart software</h3><div><p>\n            Vulnerability in OpenSolution Quick.Cart software\nCVE ID\nCVE-2025-10317\nPublication date\n30 October 2025\nVendor\nOpenSolution\nProduct\nQuick.Cart\nVulnerable versions\n6.7\nVulnerability type (CWE)\nCross-S ... <a href=\"https://cert.pl/en/posts/2025/10/CVE-2025-10317/\"></a></p><p>Vulnerabilities has been mentioned in this article.</p></div>","contentLength":318,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ThreatsDay Bulletin: DNS Poisoning Flaw, Supply-Chain Heist, Rust Malware Trick and New RATs Rising","url":"https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/threatsday-bulletin-dns-poisoning-flaw.html","date":1761821640,"author":"The Hacker News","guid":3535,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The comfort zone in cybersecurity is gone.
