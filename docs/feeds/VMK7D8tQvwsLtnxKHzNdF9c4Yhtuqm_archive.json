Privacy on the Internet is a somewhat nebulous\nconcept, but one aspect of privacy is surely the prevention of your web\nbrowsing behaviour being propagated from one organization to another. I\ndon’t want my medical insurers to know, for example, that I’ve been\nresearching coronary artery disease. And even though my personal safety\nand liberty probably aren’t at stake, I don’t want to give any support\nto the global advertising behemoth, by allowing advertisers access to\nbetter information about me.</p><p>Unfortunately, while distancing yourself from Google and its services\nmight be a necessary first step in protecting your privacy, it’s far\nfrom the last. There’s more to do, and it’s getting harder to do it,\nbecause of browser fingerprinting.</p><p>Until about five years ago, our main concern surrounding browser\nprivacy was probably the use of third-party tracking cookies. The\noriginal intent behind cookies was that they would allow a web browser\nand a web server to engage in a conversation over a period of time. The\nHTTP protocol that web servers use is ; that is, each\ninteraction between browser and server is expected to be complete in\nitself. Having the browser and the server exchange a cookie (which could\njust be a random number) in each interaction allowed the server to\nassociate each browser with an ongoing conversation. This was, and is, a\nlegitimate use of cookies, one that is necessary for almost all\ninteractive web-based services. If the cookie is short-lived, and only\napplies to a single conversation with a single web server, it’s not a\nprivacy concern.</p><p>Unfortunately, web browsers for a long time lacked the ability to\ndistinguish between privacy-sparing and privacy-breaking uses of\ncookies. If many different websites issue pages that contain links to\nthe same server – usually some kind of advertising service – then the\nbrowser would send cookies to that server, thinking it was being\nhelpful. This behaviour effectively linked web-based services together,\nallowing them to share information about their users. The process is a\nbit more complicated than I’m making it out to be, but these third-party\ncookies were of such concern that, in Europe at least, legislation was\nenacted to force websites to disclose that they were using them.</p><p>Browsers eventually got better at figuring out which cookies were\nhelpful and which harmful and, for the most part, we don’t need to be\ntoo concerned about ‘tracking cookies’ these days. Not only can browsers\nmitigate their risks, there’s a far more sinister one: browser\nfingerprinting.</p><p>Browser fingerprinting does not depend on cookies. It’s resistant, to\nsome extent, to privacy measures like VPNs. Worst of all, steps that we\nmight take to mitigate the risk of fingerprinting can actually worsen\nthe risk. It’s a privacy nightmare, and it’s getting worse.</p><p>Fingerprinting works by having the web server extract certain\ndiscrete elements of information from the browser, and combining those\nelements into a numerical identifier. Some of the information supplied\nby the browser is fundamental and necessary and, although a browser\ncould fake it, such a measure is likely to break the website.</p><p>For example, a fingerprinting system knows, just from information\nthat my browser always supplies (and probably has to), that I’m using\nversion 144 of the Firefox browser, on Linux; my preferred language is\nEnglish, and my time-zone is GMT. That, by itself, isn’t enough\ninformation to identify me uniquely, but it’s a step towards doing\nso.</p><p>To get more information, the fingerprinter needs to use more\nsophisticated methods which the browser could, in theory, block. For\nexample, if the browser supports JavaScript – and they nearly all do –\nthen the fingerprinter can figure out what fonts I have installed, what\nbrowser extensions I use, perhaps even what my hardware is. Worst of\nall, perhaps, it can extract a . Canvas\nfingerprinting works by having the browser run code that draws text\n(perhaps invisibly), and then retrieving the individual pixel data that\nit drew. This pixel data will differ subtly from one system to another,\neven drawing the same text, because of subtle differences in the\ngraphics hardware and the operating system.</p><p>It appears that only about one browser in every thousand share the\nsame canvas fingerprint. Again, this alone isn’t enough to identify me,\nbut it’s another significant data point.</p><p>Fingerprinting can make use of even what appears to be trivial\ninformation. If, for example, I resize my browser window, the browser\nwill probably make the next window the same size. It will probably\nremember my preference from one day to the next. If the fingerprinter\nknows my preferred browser window size is, say, 1287x892 pixels, that\nprobably narrows down the search for my identify by a factor of a\nthousand or more.</p><h2>Why crude\nmethods to defeat fingerprinting don’t work</h2><p>You might think that a simple way to prevent, or at least hamper,\nfingerprinting would be simply to disable JavaScript support in the\nbrowser. While this does defeat measures like canvas fingerprinting, it\ngenerates a significant data point of its own: the fact that JavaScript\nis disabled. Since almost every web browser in the world now supports\nJavaScript, turning it off as a measure to protect privacy is like going\nto the shopping mall wearing a ski mask. Sure, it hides your identify;\nbut nobody’s going to want to serve you in stores. And disabling\nJavaScript will break many websites, including some pages on this one,\nbecause I use it to render math equations.</p><p>Less dramatic approaches to fingerprinting resistance have their own\nproblems. For example, a debate has long raged about whether a browser\nshould actually identify itself at all. The fact that I’m running\nFirefox on Linux probably puts me in a small, easily identified group.\nPerhaps my browser should instead tell the server I’m running Chrome on\nWindows? That’s a much larger group, after all.</p><p>The problem is that the fingerprinters can guess the browser and\nplatform with pretty good accuracy using other methods, whether the\nbrowser reports this information or not. If the browser says something\ndifferent to what the fingerprinter infers, we’re back in ski-mask\nterritory.</p><p>What about more subtle methods to spoof the client’s behaviour?\nBrowsers (or plug-ins) can modify the canvas drawing procedures, for\nexample, to spoof the results of canvas fingerprinting. Unfortunately,\nthese methods leave traces of their own, if they aren’t applied subtly.\nWhat’s more, if they’re applied rigorously enough to be effective, they\ncan break websites that rely on them for normal operation.</p><p>All in all, browser fingerprinting is very hard to defeat, and\norganizations that want to track us have gotten disturbingly good at\nit.</p><p>Before sinking into despondency, it’s worth bearing in mind that\nwebsites that attempt to demonstrate the efficacy of fingerprinting,\nlike <a href=\"https://amiunique.org\">amiunique</a> and <a href=\"https://fingerprint.com\">fingerprint.com</a> do not reflect how\nfingerprinting works in the real world. They’re operating on\ncomparatively small sets of data and, for the most part, they’re not\ntracking users over days. Real-world tracking is much harder than these\nsites make it out to be. That’s not to say it’s  hard but it\nis, at best, a statistical approach, rather than an exact one.</p><p>In addition ‘uniqueness’, in itself, is not a strong measure of\ntraceability. That my browser fingerprint is unique at some point in\ntime is irrelevant if my fingerprint will be different tomorrow, whether\nit remains unique within the fingerprinter’s database or not.</p><p>Of course, these facts also mean that it’s difficult to assess the\neffectiveness of our countermeasures: our assessment can only be\napproximate, because we don’t actually know what real fingerprinters are\ndoing.</p><p>Another small piece of good news is that browser developers are\nstarting to realize how much of a hazard fingerprinting is, and to\nintegrate more robust countermeasures. We don’t necessarily need to\nresort to plug-ins and extensions, which are themselves detectable and\nbecome part of the fingerprint. At present, Brave and Mullvad seems to\nbe doing the most to resist fingerprinting, albeit in different ways.\nLibrewolf has the same fingerprint resistance as Firefox, but it is\nturned on by default. Probably anti-fingerprinting methods will improve\nover time but, of course, the fingerprinters will get better at what\nthey do, too.</p><p>First, and most obviously, if you care about avoiding tracking, you\n prevent long-lived cookies hanging around in the browser,\nand you  use a VPN. Ideally the VPN should rotate its\nendpoint regularly.</p><p>The fact that you’re using a VPN, of course, is something that the\nfingerprinters will know, and it is does make you stand out.\nSophisticated fingerprinters won’t be defeated by a VPN alone. But if\nyou don’t use a VPN, the trackers don’t even  to\nfingerprint you: your IP number, combined with a few other bits of\nroutine information, will identify you immediately, and with\nnear-certainty.</p><p>Many browsers can be configured to remove cookies when they seem not\nto be in use; Librewolf does this by default, and Firefox and Chrome do\nit in ‘incognito’ mode. The downside, of course, is that long-lived\ncookies are often used to store authentication status so, if you delete\nthem, you’ll find yourself having to log in every time you look at a\nsite that requires authentication. To mitigate this annoyance, browsers\ngenerally allow particular sites to be excluded from their\ncookie-burning policies.</p><p>Next, you need to be as unremarkable as possible. Fingerprinting is\nabout uniqueness, so you should use the most popular browser on the most\npopular operating system on the kind of hardware you can buy from PC\nWorld. If you’re running the latest Chrome on the latest Windows 11 on a\ntwo-year-old, bog-standard laptop, you’re going to be one of a very\nlarge group. Of course Chrome, being a Google product, has its own\nprivacy concerns, so you might be better off using a Chromium-based\nbrowser with reduced Google influence, like Brave.</p><p>You should endeavour to keep your computer in as near its stock\nconfiguration as possible. Don’t install anything (like fonts) that are\nreportable by the browser. Don’t install any extensions, and don’t\nchange any settings. Use the same ‘light’ theme as everybody else, and\nuse the browser with a maximized window, and always the same size. And\nso on.</p><p>If possible, use a browser that has built-in fingerprint resistance,\nlike Mullvad or Librewolf (or Firefox with these features turned\non).</p><p>If you take all these precautions, you can probably reduce the\nprobability that you can be tracked by you browser fingerprint, over\ndays or weeks, from about 99% to about 50%.</p><p>50% is still too high, of course.</p><h2>The downsides of\nresisting fingerprinting</h2><p>If you enable fingerprinting resistance in Firefox, or use Librewolf,\nyou’ll immediately encounter oddities. Most obviously, every time you\nopen a new browser window, it will be the same size. Resizing the window\nmay have odd results, as the browser will try to constrain certain\nscreen elements to common size multiples. In addition, you won’t be able\nto change the theme.</p><p>You’ll probably find yourself facing more ‘CAPTCHA’ and similar\nidentity challenges, because your browser will be unknown to the server.\nWebsites don’t do this out of spite: hacking and fraud are rife on the\nInternet, and the operators of web-based services are rightly paranoid\nabout client behaviour.</p><p>You’ll likely find that some websites just don’t work properly, in\nmany small ways: wrong colours, misplaced text, that kind of thing. I’ve\nfound these issues to be irritations rather than show-stoppers, but you\nmight discover otherwise.</p><h2>Is browser fingerprinting\nlegal?</h2><p>The GDPR is, for the most part, technologically neutral, although it\nhas specific provisions for cookies, which were a significant concern at\nthe time it was drafted. So far as I know, nobody has yet challenged\nbrowser fingerprinting under the GDPR, even though it seems to violate\nthe provisions regarding consent. Since there are legitimate reasons for\nfingerprinting, such as hacking detection, organizations that do it\ncould perhaps defend against a legal challenge on the basis that\nfingerprinting is necessary to operate their services safely. In the\nend, we really need specific, new legislation to address this privacy\nthreat.</p><p>I suspect that many people who take an interest in Internet privacy\ndon’t appreciate how hard it is to resist browser fingerprinting. Taking\nsteps to reduce it leads to inconvenience and, with the present state of\ntechnology, even the most intrusive approaches are only partially\neffective. The data collected by fingerprinting is invisible to the\nuser, and stored somewhere beyond the user’s reach.</p><p>On the other hand, browser fingerprinting produces only statistical\nresults, and usually can’t be used to track or identify a user with\ncertainty. The data it collects has a relatively short lifespan – days\nto weeks, not months or years. While it probably can be used for\nsinister purposes, my main concern is that it supports the intrusive,\nout-of-control online advertising industry, which has made a wasteland\nof the Internet.</p><p>In the end, it’s probably only going to be controlled by legislation\nand, even when that happens, the advertisers will seek new ways to make\nthe Internet even more of a hellscape – they always do.</p>","contentLength":13574,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46016249"},{"title":"In a U.S. First, New Mexico Opens Doors to Free Child Care for All","url":"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/in-a-u-s-first-new-mexico-opens-doors-to-free-child-care-for-all-2dfdea96","date":1763827872,"author":"nairteashop","guid":6166,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46015763"},{"title":"Agent design is still hard","url":"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/11/21/agents-are-hard/","date":1763810844,"author":"the_mitsuhiko","guid":6162,"unread":true,"content":"<p data-date=\"2025-11-21T00:00:00\">written on November 21, 2025</p><p>I felt like it might be a good time to write about some new things I’ve\nlearned.  Most of this is going to be about building agents, with a little bit\nabout using agentic coding tools.</p><p>TL;DR: Building agents is still messy.  SDK abstractions break once you hit\nreal tool use.  Caching works better when you manage it yourself, but differs\nbetween models.  Reinforcement ends up doing more heavy lifting than expected,\nand failures need strict isolation to avoid derailing the loop.  Shared state\nvia a file-system-like layer is an important building block.  Output tooling is\nsurprisingly tricky, and model choice still depends on the task.</p><h2>Which Agent SDK To Target?</h2><p>When you build your own agent, you have the choice of targeting an underlying\nSDK like the OpenAI SDK or the Anthropic SDK, or you can go with a higher level\nabstraction such as the Vercel AI SDK or Pydantic.  The choice we made a while\nback was to adopt the Vercel AI SDK but only the provider abstractions, and to\nbasically <a href=\"https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/node/manual-agent-loop\">drive the agent loop\nourselves</a>.  At this point\n<a href=\"https://earendil.com/\">we</a> would not make that choice again.  There is\nabsolutely nothing wrong with the Vercel AI SDK, but when you are trying to\nbuild an agent, two things happen that we originally didn’t anticipate:</p><p>The first is that the differences between models are significant enough that\nyou will need to build your own agent abstraction.  We have not found any of\nthe solutions from these SDKs that build the right abstraction for an agent.  I\nthink this is partly because, despite the basic agent design being just a loop,\nthere are subtle differences based on the tools you provide.  These differences\naffect how easy or hard it is to find the right abstraction (cache control,\ndifferent requirements for reinforcement, tool prompts, provider-side tools,\netc.).  Because the right abstraction is not yet clear, using the original SDKs\nfrom the dedicated platforms keeps you fully in control.  With some of these\nhigher-level SDKs you have to build on top of their existing abstractions,\nwhich might not be the ones you actually want in the end.</p><p>We also found it incredibly challenging to work with the Vercel SDK when it\ncomes to dealing with provider-side tools.  The attempted unification of\nmessaging formats doesn’t quite work.  For instance, the web search tool from\nAnthropic routinely destroys the message history with the Vercel SDK, and we\nhaven’t yet fully figured out the cause.  Also, in Anthropic’s case, cache\nmanagement is much easier when targeting their SDK directly instead of the\nVercel one.  The error messages when you get things wrong are much clearer.</p><p>This might change, but right now we would probably not use an abstraction when\nbuilding an agent, at least until things have settled down a bit.  The benefits\ndo not yet outweigh the costs for us.</p><p>Someone else might have figured it out.  If you’re reading this and think I’m\nwrong, please drop me a mail.  I want to learn.</p><p>The different platforms have very different approaches to caching.  A lot has\nbeen said about this already, but Anthropic makes you pay for caching.  It\nmakes you manage cache points explicitly, and this really changes the way you\ninteract with it from an agent engineering level.  I initially found the manual\nmanagement pretty dumb.  Why doesn’t the platform do this for me?  But I’ve\nfully come around and now vastly prefer explicit cache management.  It makes\ncosts and cache utilization much more predictable.</p><p>Explicit caching allows you to do certain things that are much harder\notherwise.  For instance, you can split off a conversation and have it run in\ntwo different directions simultaneously.  You also have the opportunity to do\ncontext editing.  The optimal strategy here is unclear, but you clearly have a\nlot more control, and I really like having that control.  It also makes it much\neasier to understand the cost of the underlying agent.  You can assume much\nmore about how well your cache will be utilized, whereas with other platforms\nwe found it to be hit and miss.</p><p>The way we do caching in the agent with Anthropic is pretty straightforward.\nOne cache point is after the system prompt.  Two cache points are placed at the\nbeginning of the conversation, where the last one moves up with the tail of the\nconversation.  And then there is some optimization along the way that you can\ndo.</p><p>Because the system prompt and the tool selection now have to be mostly static,\nwe feed a dynamic message later to provide information such as the current\ntime.  Otherwise, this would trash the cache.  We also leverage reinforcement\nduring the loop much more.</p><h2>Reinforcement In The Agent Loop</h2><p>Every time the agent runs a tool you have the opportunity to not just return\ndata that the tool produces, but also to feed more information back into the\nloop.  For instance, you can remind the agent about the overall objective and\nthe status of individual tasks.  You can also provide hints about how the tool\ncall might succeed when a tool fails.  Another use of reinforcement is to\ninform the system about state changes that happened in the background.  If you\nhave an agent that uses parallel processing, you can inject information after\nevery tool call when that state changed and when it is relevant for completing\nthe task.</p><p>Sometimes it’s enough for the agent to self-reinforce.  In Claude Code, for\ninstance, the todo write tool is a self-reinforcement tool.  All it does is\ntake from the agent a list of tasks that it thinks it should do and echo out\nwhat came in.  It’s basically just an echo tool; it really doesn’t do anything\nelse.  But that is enough to drive the agent forward better than if the only\ntask and subtask were given at the beginning of the context and too much has\nhappened in the meantime.</p><p>We also use reinforcements to inform the system if the environment changed\nduring execution in a way that’s problematic for the agent.  For instance, if\nour agent fails and retries from a certain step forward but the recovery\noperates off broken data, we inject a message informing it that it might want\nto back off a couple of steps and redo an earlier step.</p><p>If you expect a lot of failures during code execution, there is an opportunity\nto hide those failures from the context.  This can happen in two ways.  One is\nto run tasks that might require iteration individually.  You would run them in\na subagent until they succeed and only report back the success, plus maybe a\nbrief summary of approaches that did not work.  It is helpful for an agent to\nlearn about what did not work in a subtask because it can then feed that\ninformation into the next task to hopefully steer away from those failures.</p><p>The second option doesn’t exist in all agents or foundation models, but with\nAnthropic you can do context editing.  So far we haven’t had a lot of success\nwith context editing, but we believe it’s an interesting thing we would love to\nexplore more.  We would also love to learn if people have success with it.\nWhat is interesting about context editing is that you should be able to\npreserve tokens for further down the iteration loop.  You can take out of the\ncontext certain failures that didn’t drive towards successful completion of the\nloop, but only negatively affected certain attempts during execution.  But as\nwith the point I made earlier: it is also useful for the agent to understand\nwhat didn’t work, but maybe it doesn’t require the full state and full output\nof all the failures.</p><p>Unfortunately, context editing will automatically invalidate caches.  There is\nreally no way around it.  So it can be unclear when the trade-off of doing that\ncompensates for the extra cost of trashing the cache.</p><h2>Sub Agents / Sub Inference</h2><p>As I mentioned a couple of times on this blog already, most of our agents are\nbased on code execution and code generation.  That really requires a common\nplace for the agent to store data.  Our choice is a file system—in our case a\nvirtual file system—but that requires different tools to access it.  This is\nparticularly important if you have something like a subagent or subinference.</p><p>You should try to build an agent that doesn’t have dead ends.  A dead end is\nwhere a task can only continue executing within the sub-tool that you built.\nFor instance, you might build a tool that generates an image, but is only able\nto feed that image back into one more tool.  That’s a problem because you might\nthen want to put those images into a zip archive using the code execution tool.\nSo there needs to be a system that allows the image generation tool to write\nthe image to the same place where the code execution tool can read it.  In\nessence, that’s a file system.</p><p>Obviously it has to go the other way around too.  You might want to use the\ncode execution tool to unpack a zip archive and then go back to inference to\ndescribe all the images so that the next step can go back to code execution and\nso forth.  The file system is the mechanism that we use for that.  But it does\nrequire tools to be built in a way that they can take file paths to the virtual\nfile system to work with.</p><p>So basically an  tool would have access to the same file system as\nthe  tool which could take a  to a file on that same\nvirtual file system.</p><h2>The Use Of An Output Tool</h2><p>One interesting thing about how we structured our agent is that it does not\nrepresent a chat session.  It will eventually communicate something to the user\nor the outside world, but all the messages that it sends in between are usually\nnot revealed.  The question is: how does it create that message?  We have one\ntool which is the output tool.  The agent uses it explicitly to communicate to\nthe human.  We then use a prompt to instruct it when to use that tool.  In our\ncase the output tool sends an email.</p><p>But that turns out to pose a few other challenges.  One is that it’s\nsurprisingly hard to steer the wording and tone of that output tool compared to\njust using the main agent loop’s text output as the mechanism to talk to the\nuser.  I cannot say why this is, but I think it’s probably related to how these\nmodels are trained.</p><p>One attempt that didn’t work well was to have the output tool run another quick\nLLM like Gemini 2.5 Flash to adjust the tone to our preference.  But this\nincreases latency and actually reduces the quality of the output.  In part, I\nthink the model just doesn’t word things correctly and the subtool doesn’t have\nsufficient context.  Providing more slices of the main agentic context into the\nsubtool makes it expensive and also didn’t fully solve the problem.  It also\nsometimes reveals information in the final output that we didn’t want to be\nthere, like the steps that led to the end result.</p><p>Another problem with an output tool is that sometimes it just doesn’t call the\ntool.  One of the ways in which we’re forcing this is we remember if the output\ntool was called.  If the loop ends without the output tool, we inject a\nreinforcement message to encourage it to use the output tool.</p><p>Overall our choices for models haven’t dramatically changed so far.  I think\nHaiku and Sonnet are still the best tool callers available, so they make for\nexcellent choices in the agent loop.  They are also somewhat transparent with\nregards to what the RL looks like.  The other obvious choices are the Gemini\nmodels.  We so far haven’t found a ton of success with the GPT family of models\nfor the main loop.</p><p>For the individual sub-tools, which in part might also require inference, our\ncurrent choice is Gemini 2.5 if you need to summarize large documents or work\nwith PDFs and things like that.  That is also a pretty good model for\nextracting information from images, in particular because the Sonnet family of\nmodels likes to run into a safety filter which can be annoying.</p><p>There’s also probably the very obvious realization that token cost alone\ndoesn’t really define how expensive an agent.  A better tool caller will do the\njob in fewer tokens.  There are some cheaper models available than sonnet\ntoday, but they are not  cheaper in a loop.</p><p>But all things considered, not that much has changed in the last couple of\nweeks.</p><p>We find testing and evals to be the hardest problem here.  This is not entirely\nsurprising, but the agentic nature makes it even harder.  Unlike prompts, you\ncannot just do the evals in some external system because there’s too much you\nneed to feed into it.  This means you want to do evals based on observability\ndata or instrumenting your actual test runs.  So far none of the solutions we\nhave tried have convinced us that they found the right approach here.\nUnfortunately, I have to report that at the moment we haven’t found something\nthat really makes us happy.  I hope we’re going to find a solution for this\nbecause it is becoming an increasingly frustrating aspect of building an agent.</p><p>As for my experience with coding agents, not really all that much has changed.\nThe main new development is that I’m trialing <a href=\"https://ampcode.com/\">Amp</a> more.\nIn case you’re curious why: it’s not that it’s objectively a better agent than\nwhat I’m using, but I really quite like the way they’re thinking about agents\nfrom what they’re posting.  The interactions of the different sub agents like\nthe Oracle with the main loop is beautifully done, and not many other harnesses\ndo this today.  It’s also a good way for me to validate how different agent\ndesigns work.  Amp, similar to Claude Code, really feels like a product built\nby people who also use their own tool.  I do not feel every other agent in the\nindustry does this.</p><h2>Quick Stuff I Read And Found</h2><p>That’s just a random assortment of things that I feel might also be worth\nsharing:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/\">What if you don’t need MCP at\nall?</a>:\nMario argues that many MCP servers are overengineered and include large\ntoolsets that consume lots of context.

In particular, the long battery runtimes—usually one of the strong arguments for ARM devices—were not achieved under Linux.

Successors to the highly successful <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex\">Valve Index</a> and <a href=\"https://www.steamdeck.com/en/\">Steam Deck</a>, these devices are set to be released in the coming year.</p><p>Igalia has long worked with Valve on SteamOS, which will power the Machine and Frame, and is excited to be contributing to these new devices, particularly the Frame.  The Frame, unlike the Machine or Deck which have x86 CPUs, runs on an ARM-based CPU.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this would mean that only games compiled to run on ARM chips could be played on the Frame.  In order to get around this barrier, a translation layer called <a href=\"https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX\">FEX</a> is used to run applications compiled for x86 chips (which are used in nearly all gaming PCs) on ARM chips by translating the x86 machine code into ARM64 machine code.</p><p>“If you love video games, like I do, working on FEX with Valve is a dream come true,” said <a href=\"https://igalia.com/team/pmatos\">Paulo Matos</a>, an engineer with Igalia’s <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/technology/compilers\">Compilers Team</a>.  Even so, the challenges can be daunting, because making sure the translation is working often requires manual QA rather than automated testing.  “You have to start a game, sometimes the error shows up in the colors or sound, or how the game behaves when you break down the door in the second level. Just debugging this can take a while,” said Matos.  “For optimization work I did early last year, I used a game called  to test it. I must have played the first 3 to 4 minutes of the game many, many times for debugging. Looking at my history, Steam tells me I played it for 29 hours, but it was always the first few minutes, nothing else.”</p><p>Beyond the CPU, the Qualcomm Adreno 750 GPU used in the Steam Frame introduced its own set of challenges when it came to running desktop games, and other complex workloads, on these devices. Doing so requires a rock-solid Vulkan driver that can ensure correctness, eliminating major rendering bugs, while maintaining high performance.  This is a very difficult combination to achieve, and yet that’s exactly what we’ve done for Valve with <a href=\"https://mesa3d.org/\">Mesa3D</a><a href=\"https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/freedreno.html#turnip\">Turnip</a>, a FOSS Vulkan driver for Qualcomm Adreno GPUs.</p><p>“We implemented many Vulkan extensions and reviewed numerous others,” said <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/team/dpiliaiev\">Danylo Piliaiev</a>, an engineer on the <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/technology/graphics\">Graphics Team</a>. “Over the years, we ensured that D3D11, D3D12, and OpenGL games rendered correctly through DXVK, vkd3d-proton, and Zink, investigating many rendering issues along the way. We achieved higher correctness than the proprietary driver and, in many cases, Mesa3D Turnip is faster as well.”</p><p>We’ve worked with many wonderful people from Valve, Google, and other companies to iterate on the Vulkan driver over the years in order to introduce new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, as well as debugging workflows. Some of those people decided to join Igalia later on, such as our colleague and Graphics Team developer <a href=\"https://igalia.com/team/anholt\">Emma Anholt</a>. “I’ve been working on Mesa for 22 years, and it’s great to have a home now where I can keep doing that work, across hardware projects, where the organization prioritizes the work experience of its developers and empowers them within the organization.”</p><p>Valve’s support in all this cannot be understated, either.  Their choice to build their devices using open software like Mesa3D Turnip and FEX means they’re committed to working on and supporting improvements and optimizations that become available to anyone who uses the same open-source projects.</p><p>“We’ve received a lot of positive feedback about significantly improved performance and fewer rendering glitches from hobbyists who use these projects to run PC games on Android phones as a result of our work,” said <a href=\"https://igalia.com/team/mark\">Dhruv Mark Collins</a>, another Graphics Team engineer working on Turnip. “And it goes both ways! We’ve caught a couple of nasty bugs because of that widespread testing, which really emphasizes why the FOSS model is beneficial for everyone involved.”</p><p>An interesting area of graphics driver development is all the compiler work that is involved. Vulkan drivers such as Mesa3D Turnip need to process shader programs sent by the application to the GPU, and these programs govern how pixels in our screens are shaded or colored with geometry, textures, and lights while playing games. <a href=\"https://igalia.com/team/jnoorman\">Job Noorman</a>, an engineer from our Compilers Team, made significant contributions to the compiler used by Mesa3D Turnip. He also contributed to the Mesa3D NIR shader compiler, a common part that all Mesa drivers use, including <a href=\"https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/radv.html\">RADV</a> (most popularly used on the Steam Deck) or <a href=\"https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/v3d.html\">V3DV</a> (used on Raspberry Pi boards).</p><p>As is normal for Igalia, while we focused on delivering results for our customer, we also made our work as widely useful as possible.  For example: “While our target throughout our work has been the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 that’s in the Frame, much of our work extends back through years of Snapdragon hardware, and we regression test it to make sure it stays Vulkan conformant,” said Anholt.  This means that Igalia’s work for the Frame has consistently passed Vulkan’s Conformance Test Suite (CTS) of over 2.8 million tests, some of which Igalia is involved in creating.</p><blockquote><p>Igalia and other Valve contractors actively participate in several areas inside the Khronos Group, the organization maintaining and developing graphics API standards like Vulkan. We contribute specification fixes and feedback, and we are regularly involved in the development of many new Vulkan extensions. Some of these end up being critical for game developers, like mesh shading. Others ensure a smooth and efficient translation of other APIs like DirectX to Vulkan, or help take advantage of hardware features to ensure applications perform great across multiple platforms, both mobile like the Steam Frame or desktop like the Steam Machine. Having Vulkan CTS coverage for these new extensions is a critical step in the release process, helping make sure the specification is clear and drivers implement it correctly, and Igalia engineers have contributed millions of source code lines and tests since our collaboration with Valve started.</p></blockquote><p>A huge challenge we faced in moving forward with development is ensuring that we didn’t introduce regressions, small innocent-seeming changes can completely break rendering on games in a way that even CTS might not catch. What automated testing could be done was often quite constrained, but Igalians found ways to push through the barriers.  “I made a continuous integration test to automatically run single-frame captures of a wide range of games spanning D3D11, D3D9, D3D8, Vulkan, and OpenGL APIs,” said Piliaiev, about the development covered in his <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=AKGA6wsX1hs\">recent XDC 2025 talk</a>, “ensuring that we don’t have rendering or performance regressions.”</p><p>Looking ahead, Igalia’s work for Valve will continue to deliver benefits to the wider Linux Gaming ecosystem.  For example, the Steam Frame, as a battery-powered VR headset, needs to deliver high performance within a limited power budget.  A way to address this is to create a more efficient task scheduler, which is something <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/team/changwoo\">Changwoo Min</a> of Igalia’s <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/technology/kernel\">Kernel Team</a> has been working on.  As he says, “I have been developing a customized CPU scheduler for gaming, named <a href=\"https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1713/attachments/1425/3058/scx_lavd-lpc-mc-24.pdf\">LAVD: Latency-criticality Aware Virtual Deadline scheduler</a>.”</p><p>In general terms, a scheduler automatically identifies critical tasks and dynamically boosts their deadlines to improve responsiveness.  Most task schedulers don’t take energy consumption into account, but the Rust-based LAVD is different.  “LAVD makes scheduling decisions considering each chip’s performance versus energy trade-offs. It measures and predicts the required computing power on the fly, then selects the best set of CPUs to meet that demand with minimal energy consumption,” said Min.</p><p>One of our other kernel engineers, <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/team/mwen\">Melissa Wen</a>, has been working on AMD kernel display drivers to maintain good color management and HDR support for SteamOS across AMD hardware families, both for the Steam Deck and the Steam Machine. This is especially important with newer display hardware in the Steam Machine, which features some notable differences in color capabilities, aiming for more powerful and efficient color management which necessitated driver work.</p><p>…and that’s a wrap! We will continue our efforts toward improving future versions of SteamOS, and with a partner as strongly supportive as Valve, we expect to do more work to make Linux gaming even better.

The rules of the game are straightforward.  Players say the\n  numbers aloud in order beginning with one.  Whenever a number is\n  divisible by 3, they say 'Fizz' instead.  If it is divisible by 5,\n  they say 'Buzz'.  If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, the player\n  says both 'Fizz' and 'Buzz'.  Here is a typical Python program that\n  prints this sequence:\n</p><pre><code>for n in range(1, 101):\n    if n % 15 == 0:\n        print('FizzBuzz')\n    elif n % 3 == 0:\n        print('Fizz')\n    elif n % 5 == 0:\n        print('Buzz')\n    else:\n        print(n)</code></pre><p>\n  Here is the output:\n  <a href=\"https://susam.net/files/blog/fizz-buzz.txt\">fizz-buzz.txt</a>.  Can we make\n  the program more complicated?  The words 'Fizz', 'Buzz' and\n  'FizzBuzz' repeat in a periodic manner throughout the sequence.\n  What else is periodic?  Trigonometric functions!  Perhaps we can use\n  trigonometric functions to encode all four rules of the sequence in\n  a single closed-form expression.  That is what we are going to\n  explore in this article.  By the end, we will obtain a discrete\n  Fourier series that can take any integer \\( n \\) and select the\n  corresponding text to be printed.\n</p><p>\n  Before going any further, we establish a precise mathematical\n  definition for the Fizz Buzz sequence.  We begin by introducing a\n  few functions that will help us define the Fizz Buzz sequence later.\n</p><p>\n  We define a set of four functions \\( \\{ s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3 \\} \\) for\n  integers \\( n \\) by:\n\n  \\begin{align*}\n    s_0(n) &amp;= n, \\\\\n    s_1(n) &amp;= \\mathtt{Fizz}, \\\\\n    s_2(n) &amp;= \\mathtt{Buzz}, \\\\\n    s_3(n) &amp;= \\mathtt{FizzBuzz}.\n  \\end{align*}\n\n  We call these the symbol functions because they produce every term\n  that appears in the Fizz Buzz sequence.  The symbol function \\( s_0\n  \\) returns \\( n \\) itself.  The functions \\( s_1, \\) \\( s_2 \\) and\n  \\( s_3 \\) are constant functions that always return the literal\n  words \\( \\mathtt{Fizz}, \\) \\( \\mathtt{Buzz} \\) and \\(\n  \\mathtt{FizzBuzz} \\) respectively, no matter what the value of \\( n\n  \\) is.\n</p><p>\n  Now we can define the Fizz Buzz sequence as the sequence\n\n  \\[\n    (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\n  \\]\n\n  where\n\n  \\[\n    f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n      1 &amp; \\text{if } 3 \\mid n \\text{ and } 5 \\nmid n, \\\\\n      2 &amp; \\text{if } 3 \\nmid n \\text{ and } 5 \\mid n, \\\\\n      3 &amp; \\text{if } 3 \\mid n \\text{ and } 5 \\mid n, \\\\\n      0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}.\n    \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n\n  The notation \\( m \\mid n \\) means that the integer \\( m \\) divides\n  the integer \\( n, \\) i.e. \\( n \\) is a multiple of \\( m.  \\)\n  Equivalently, there exists an integer \\( c \\) such that \\( n = cm\n .  \\)  Similarly, \\( m \\nmid n \\) means that \\( m \\) does not divide\n  \\( n, \\) i.e. \\( n \\) is not a multiple of \\( m.  \\)  With the above\n  definitions in place, we can expand the first few terms of the\n  sequence explicitly as follows:\n\n  \\begin{align*}\n    (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\n    &amp;= (s_{f(1)}(1), \\; s_{f(2)}(2), \\; s_{f(3)}(3), \\; s_{f(4)}(4), \\;\n            s_{f(5)}(5), \\; s_{f(6)}(6), \\; s_{f(7)}(7), \\; \\dots) \\\\\n    &amp;= (s_0(1), \\; s_0(2), \\; s_1(3), \\; s_0(4),\n            s_2(5), \\; s_1(6), \\; s_0(7), \\; \\dots) \\\\\n    &amp;= (1, \\; 2, \\; \\mathtt{Fizz}, \\; 4, \\;\n            \\mathtt{Buzz}, \\; \\mathtt{Fizz}, \\; 7, \\; \\dots).\n  \\end{align*}\n\n  Note how the function \\( f(n) \\) produces an index \\( i \\) which we\n  then use to select the symbol function \\( s_i(n) \\) to produce the\n  \\( n \\)th term of the sequence.  We therefore call \\( f(n) \\) the\n  index function.\n</p><p>\n  Here is the index function \\( f(n) \\) from the previous section with\n  its cases and conditions rearranged to make it easier to spot\n  interesting patterns:\n\n  \\[\n    f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n      0 &amp; \\text{if } 5 \\nmid n \\text{ and } 3 \\nmid n, \\\\\n      1 &amp; \\text{if } 5 \\nmid n \\text{ and } 3 \\mid n, \\\\\n      2 &amp; \\text{if } 5 \\mid n \\text{ and } 3 \\nmid n, \\\\\n      3 &amp; \\text{if } 5 \\mid n \\text{ and } 3 \\mid n.\n    \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n\n  This function helps us to select another function \\( s_{f(n)}(n) \\)\n  which in turn determines the \\( n \\)th term of the Fizz Buzz\n  sequence.  Our goal now is to replace this piecewise formula with a\n  single closed-form expression.  To do so, we first define indicator\n  functions \\( I_m(n) \\) as follows:\n\n  \\[\n    I_m(n) = \\begin{cases}\n      1 &amp; \\text{if } m \\mid n, \\\\\n      0 &amp; \\text{if } m \\nmid n.\n    \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n\n  The formula for \\( f(n) \\) can now be written as:\n\n  \\[\n    f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n      0 &amp; \\text{if } I_5(n) = 0 \\text{ and } I_3(n) = 0, \\\\\n      1 &amp; \\text{if } I_5(n) = 0 \\text{ and } I_3(n) = 1, \\\\\n      2 &amp; \\text{if } I_5(n) = 1 \\text{ and } I_3(n) = 0, \\\\\n      3 &amp; \\text{if } I_5(n) = 1 \\text{ and } I_3(n) = 1.\n    \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n\n  Do you see a pattern?  Here is the same function written as a table:\n</p><table><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>\n  Do you see it now?  If we treat the values in the first two columns\n  as binary digits and the values in the third column as decimal\n  numbers, then in each row the first two columns give the binary\n  representation of the number in the third column.  For example, \\(\n  3_{10} = 11_2 \\) and indeed in the last row of the table, we see the\n  bits \\( 1 \\) and \\( 1 \\) in the first two columns and the number \\(\n  3 \\) in the last column.  In other words, writing the binary digits\n  \\( I_5(n) \\) and \\( I_3(n) \\) side by side gives us the binary\n  representation of \\( f(n).  \\)  Therefore\n\n  \\[\n    f(n) = 2 \\, I_5(n) + I_3(n).\n  \\]\n\n  We can now write a small program to demonstrate this formula:\n</p><pre><code>for n in range(1, 101):\n    s = [n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz']\n    i = (n % 3 == 0) + 2 * (n % 5 == 0)\n    print(s[i])</code></pre><p>\n  We can make it even shorter at the cost of some clarity:\n</p><pre><code>for n in range(1, 101):\n    print([n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz'][(n % 3 == 0) + 2 * (n % 5 == 0)])</code></pre><p>\n  What we have obtained so far is pretty good.  While there is no\n  universal definition of a closed-form expression, I think most\n  people would agree that the indicator functions as defined above are\n  simple enough to be permitted in a closed-form expression.\n</p><p>\n  In the previous section, we obtained the formula\n\n  \\[\n    f(n) = I_3(n) + 2 \\, I_5(n)\n  \\]\n\n  which we then used as an index to look up the text to be printed.\n  We also argued that this is a pretty good closed-form expression\n  already.\n</p><p>\n  However, in the interest of making things more complicated, we must\n  ask ourselves: What if we are not allowed to use the indicator\n  functions?  What if we must adhere to the commonly accepted meaning\n  of a closed-form expression which allows only finite combinations of\n  basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,\n  division, integer exponents and roots with integer index as well as\n  functions such as exponentials, logarithms and trigonometric\n  functions.  It turns out that the above formula can be rewritten\n  using only addition, multiplication, division and the cosine\n  function.  Let us begin the translation.  Consider the sum\n\n  \\[\n    S_m(n) = \\sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{2 \\pi i k n / m},\n  \\]\n\n  where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit and \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) are\n  integers.  This is a geometric series in the complex plane with\n  ratio \\( r = e^{2 \\pi i n / m}.  \\)  If \\( n \\) is a multiple of \\( m\n , \\) then \\( n = cm \\) for some integer \\( c \\) and we get\n\n  \\[\n    r\n    = e^{2 \\pi i n / m}\n    = e^{2 \\pi i c}\n    = 1.\n  \\]\n\n  Therefore, when \\( n \\) is a multiple of \\( m, \\) we get\n\n  \\[\n    S_m(n)\n    = \\sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{2 \\pi i k n / m}\n    = \\sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} 1^k\n    = m.\n  \\]\n\n  If \\( n \\) is not a multiple of \\( m, \\) then \\( r \\ne 1 \\) and the\n  geometric series becomes\n\n  \\[\n    S_m(n)\n    = \\frac{r^m - 1}{r - 1}\n    = \\frac{e^{2 \\pi i n} - 1}{e^{2 \\pi i n / m} - 1}\n    = 0.\n  \\]\n\n  Therefore,\n\n  \\[\n    S_m(n) = \\begin{cases}\n      m &amp; \\text{if } m \\mid n, \\\\\n      0 &amp; \\text{if } m \\nmid n.\n    \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n\n  Dividing both sides by \\( m, \\) we get\n\n  \\[\n    \\frac{S_m(n)}{m} = \\begin{cases}\n      1 &amp; \\text{if } m \\mid n, \\\\\n      0 &amp; \\text{if } m \\nmid n.\n    \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n\n  But the right-hand side is \\( I_m(n).  \\)  Therefore\n\n  \\[\n    I_m(n)\n    = \\frac{S_m(n)}{m}\n    = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{2 \\pi i k n / m}.\n  \\]\n</p><p>\n  We begin with Euler's formula\n\n  \\[\n    e^{i x} = \\cos x + i \\sin x\n  \\]\n\n  where \\( x \\) is a real number.  From this formula, we get\n\n  \\[\n    e^{i x} + e^{-i x} = 2 \\cos x.\n  \\]\n\n  Therefore\n\n  \\begin{align*}\n    I_3(n)\n    &amp;= \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{k = 0}^2 e^{2 \\pi i k n / 3} \\\\\n    &amp;= \\frac{1}{3} \\left( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i n / 3} +\n                                  e^{4 \\pi i n / 3} \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;= \\frac{1}{3} \\left( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i n / 3} +\n                                  e^{-2 \\pi i n / 3} \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;= \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n}{3} \\right).\n  \\end{align*}\n\n  The third equality above follows from the fact that \\( e^{4 \\pi i n\n  / 3} = e^{6 \\pi i n / 3} e^{-2 \\pi i n / 3} = e^{2 \\pi i n} e^{-2\n  \\pi i n/3} = e^{-2 \\pi i n / 3}.  \\)\n</p><p>\n  The function above is defined for integer values of \\( n \\) but we\n  can extend its formula to real \\( x \\) and plot it to observe its\n  shape between integers.  As expected, the function takes the value\n  \\( 1 \\) whenever \\( x \\) is an integer multiple of \\( 3 \\) and \\( 0\n  \\) whenever \\( x \\) is an integer not divisible by \\( 3.  \\)\n</p><p>\n  Similarly,\n\n  \\begin{align*}\n    I_5(n)\n    &amp;= \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{k = 0}^4 e^{2 \\pi i k n / 5} \\\\\n    &amp;= \\frac{1}{5} \\left( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i n / 5} +\n                                  e^{4 \\pi i n / 5} +\n                                  e^{6 \\pi i n / 5} +\n                                  e^{8 \\pi i n / 5} \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;= \\frac{1}{5} \\left( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i n / 5} +\n                                  e^{4 \\pi i n / 5} +\n                                  e^{-4 \\pi i n / 5} +\n                                  e^{-2 \\pi i n / 5} \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;= \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n}{5} \\right) +\n                         \\frac{2}{5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{4 \\pi n}{5} \\right).\n  \\end{align*}\n\n  Extending this expression to real values of \\( x \\) allows us to\n  plot its shape as well.  Once again, the function takes the value \\(\n  1 \\) at integer multiples of \\( 5 \\) and \\( 0 \\) at integers not\n  divisible by \\( 5.  \\)\n</p><p>\n  Recall that we expressed \\( f(n) \\) as\n\n  \\[\n    f(n) = I_3(n) + 2 \\, I_5(n).\n  \\]\n\n  Substituting these trigonometric expressions yields\n\n  \\[\n    f(n)\n    = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n}{3} \\right) +\n      2 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n}{5} \\right) +\n                         \\frac{2}{5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{4 \\pi n}{5} \\right) \\right).\n  \\]\n\n  A straightforward simplification gives\n\n  \\[\n    f(n)\n    = \\frac{11}{15} +\n      \\frac{2}{3} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n}{3} \\right) +\n      \\frac{4}{5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n}{5} \\right) +\n      \\frac{4}{5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{4 \\pi n}{5} \\right).\n  \\]\n\n  We can extend this expression to real \\( x \\) and plot it as well.\n  The resulting curve takes the values \\( 0, 1, 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\) at\n  integer points, as desired.\n</p><p>\n  Now we can write our Python program as follows:\n</p><pre><code>from math import cos, pi\nfor n in range(1, 101):\n    s = [n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz']\n    i = round(11 / 15 + (2 / 3) * cos(2 * pi * n / 3)\n                      + (4 / 5) * cos(2 * pi * n / 5)\n                      + (4 / 5) * cos(4 * pi * n / 5))\n    print(s[i])</code></pre><h2>Discrete Fourier Transform<a href=\"https://susam.net/fizz-buzz-with-cosines.html#dft\"></a></h2><p>\n  The keen-eyed might notice that the expression we obtained for \\(\n  f(n) \\) is a finite Fourier series.  This is not surprising, since\n  the output of a Fizz Buzz programme depends only on \\( n \\bmod 15\n .  \\)  Any function on a finite cyclic group can be written exactly as\n  a finite Fourier expansion.  In this section, we recover the same\n  function \\( f(n) \\) using the discrete Fourier transform.  It is\n  worth mentioning here that the calculations presented here are quite\n  tedious to do by hand.  Nevertheless, this section offers a glimpse\n  of how such coefficients are calculated.  By the end, we will arrive\n  at exactly the same \\( f(n) \\) as before.  There is nothing new to\n  discover here.  We simply obtain the result by a different, more\n  direct and noticeably tedious method.  If this doesn't sound\n  interesting to you, you may safely skip this section.\n</p><p>\n  We know that \\( f(n) \\) is a periodic function with period \\( 15.  \\)\n  To apply the discrete Fourier transform, we look at one complete\n  period using the indices \\( n = 1, 2, \\dots, 15.  \\)  Over this\n  period, the values are:\n\n  \\begin{array}{c|ccccccccccccccc}\n    n    &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 &amp; 10 &amp; 11 &amp; 12 &amp; 13 &amp; 14 &amp; 15 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    f(n) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;  2 &amp;  0 &amp;  1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  3\n  \\end{array}\n\n  The discrete Fourier transform gives us the constants defined by:\n\n  \\[\n    c_k = \\frac{1}{15} \\sum_{n = 1}^{15} f(n) e^{-2 \\pi i k n / 15},\n  \\]\n\n  for \\( k = 1, 2, \\dots, 15.  \\)  These constants reconstruct \\( f(n)\n  \\) via the inverse transform:\n\n  \\[\n    f(n) = \\sum_{k = 1}^{15} c_k e^{2 \\pi i k n / 15}\n  \\]\n\n  where \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z}.  \\)  Let us compute the first constant:\n\n  \\[\n    c_1 = \\frac{1}{15}\\left(\n      \\begin{aligned}\n        e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 3/15}\n        &amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 5/15}\n        + e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 6/15}\n        + e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 9/15} \\\\\n        &amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 10/15}\n        + e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 12/15}\n        + 3 e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 15/15}\n      \\end{aligned}\n    \\right) = 0.\n  \\]\n\n  Similarly,\n\n  \\[\n    c_2 = \\frac{1}{15}\\left(\n      \\begin{aligned}\n        e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 6/15}\n        &amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 10/15}\n        + e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 12/15}\n        + e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 18/15} \\\\\n        &amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 20/15}\n        + e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 24/15}\n        + 3 e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 30/15}\n      \\end{aligned}\n    \\right) = 0.\n  \\]\n\n  and\n\n  \\[\n    c_3 = \\frac{1}{15}\\left(\n      \\begin{aligned}\n        e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 9/15}\n        &amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 15/15}\n        + e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 18/15}\n        + e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 27/15} \\\\\n        &amp;+ 2 e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 30/15}\n        + e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 36/15}\n        + 3 e^{-2 \\pi i \\cdot 45/15}\n      \\end{aligned}\n    \\right) = \\frac{2}{5}.\n  \\]\n\n  Continuing in this manner, we find all the constants:\n\n  \\begin{align*}\n    c_1 &amp;= c_2 = c_4 = c_7 = c_8 = c_{11} = c_{13} = c_{14} = 0, \\\\\n    c_3 &amp;= c_6 = c_9 = c_{12} = \\frac{2}{5}, \\\\\n    c_5 &amp;= c_{10} = \\frac{1}{3}, \\\\\n    c_{15} &amp;= \\frac{11}{15}.\n  \\end{align*}\n\n  Using the inverse transform, we get\n\n  \\begin{align*}\n    f(n)\n    &amp;= \\sum_{k = 1}^{15} c_k \\, e^{2 \\pi i k n / 15} \\\\\n    &amp;= \\frac{11}{15} +\n      \\frac{2}{5} \\left(\n        e^{2 \\pi i \\cdot 3n/15} +\n        e^{2 \\pi i \\cdot 6n/15} +\n        e^{2 \\pi i \\cdot 9n/15} +\n        e^{2 \\pi i \\cdot 12n/15}\n      \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;\\phantom{=} \\phantom{\\frac{11}{15}} +\n      \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\n        e^{2 \\pi i \\cdot 5n/15} +\n        e^{2 \\pi i \\cdot 10n/15}\n      \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;= \\frac{11}{15} +\n      \\frac{2}{5} \\left(\n        e^{6 \\pi i n/15} +\n        e^{12 \\pi i n/15} +\n        e^{18 \\pi i n/15} +\n        e^{24 \\pi i n/15}\n      \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;\\phantom{=} \\phantom{\\frac{11}{15}} +\n      \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\n        e^{10 \\pi i n/15} +\n        e^{20 \\pi i n/15}\n      \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;= \\frac{11}{15} +\n       \\frac{2}{5} \\left(\n         e^{6 \\pi i n/15} +\n         e^{12 \\pi i n/15} +\n         e^{-12 \\pi i n/15} +\n         e^{-6 \\pi i n/15}\n       \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;\\phantom{=} \\phantom{\\frac{11}{15}} +\n      \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\n        e^{10 \\pi i n/15} +\n        e^{-10 \\pi i n/15}\n      \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;= \\frac{11}{15} +\n       \\frac{2}{5} \\left(\n         2 \\cos \\left( \\frac{6 \\pi n}{15} \\right) +\n         2 \\cos \\left( \\frac{12 \\pi n}{15} \\right)\n       \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;\\phantom{=} \\phantom{\\frac{11}{15}} +\n      \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\n        2 \\cos \\left( \\frac{10 \\pi n}{15} \\right)\n      \\right) \\\\\n    &amp;= \\frac{11}{15} +\n       \\frac{4}{5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n}{5} \\right) +\n       \\frac{4}{5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{4 \\pi n}{5} \\right) +\n       \\frac{2}{3} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n}{3} \\right).\n  \\end{align*}\n\n  This gives us exactly the same function \\( f(n) \\) we obtained\n  earlier.  The difference is only in how we arrived there.  Working\n  out Fourier coefficients by hand is slow and mechanical.  In\n  practice these sums are almost always computed automatically by\n  numerical software or computer algebra systems.  Still, this\n  exercise shows that our humble Fizz Buzz index function can be\n  expressed precisely using the machinery of Fourier analysis.\n</p><p>\n  To summarise, we have defined the Fizz Buzz sequence as\n\n  \\[\n    (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\n  \\]\n\n  where\n\n  \\[\n    f(n)\n    = \\frac{11}{15} +\n      \\frac{2}{3} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n}{3} \\right) +\n      \\frac{4}{5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi n}{5} \\right) +\n      \\frac{4}{5} \\cos \\left( \\frac{4 \\pi n}{5} \\right).\n  \\]\n\n  and \\( s_0(n) = n, \\) \\( s_1(n) = \\mathtt{Fizz}, \\) \\( s_2(n) =\n  \\mathtt{Buzz} \\) and \\( s_3(n) = \\mathtt{FizzBuzz}.  \\)  A Python\n  program to print the Fizz Buzz sequence based on this definition was\n  presented earlier.  That program can be written more succinctly as\n  follows:\n</p><pre><code>from math import cos, pi\nfor n in range(1, 101):\n    print([n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz'][round(11 / 15 + (2 / 3) * cos(2 * pi * n / 3) + (4 / 5) * (cos(2 * pi * n / 5) + cos(4 * pi * n / 5)))])</code></pre><p>\n  We can also wrap this up nicely in a shell one-liner, in case you\n  want to share it with your friends and family and surprise them:\n</p><pre><code>python3 -c 'from math import cos, pi; [print([n, \"Fizz\", \"Buzz\", \"FizzBuzz\"][round(11/15 + (2/3) * cos(2*pi*n/3) + (4/5) * (cos(2*pi*n/5) + cos(4*pi*n/5)))]) for n in range(1, 101)]'</code></pre><p>\n  We have taken a simple counting game and turned it into a\n  trigonometric construction: a finite Fourier series with a constant\n  term \\( 11/15 \\) and three cosine terms with coefficients \\( 2/3, \\)\n  \\( 4/5 \\) and \\( 4/5.  \\)  None of this makes Fizz Buzz any easier,\n  of course, but it does show that every \\( \\mathtt{Fizz} \\) and \\(\n  \\mathtt{Buzz} \\) now owes its existence to a particular set of\n  Fourier coefficients.  We began with the modest goal of making this\n  simple problem more complicated.  I think it is safe to say that we\n  did not fall short.\n</p>","contentLength":18366,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46006598"},{"title":"How Cops Are Using Flock's ALPR Network

The maker community immediately worried that Qualcomm would kill the open-source ethos that made Arduino the lingua franca of hobby electronics.</p><p>This week, Arduino published updated <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/terms-conditions\">terms and conditions</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy\">new privacy policy</a>, clearly rewritten by Qualcomm’s lawyers. The changes confirm the community’s worst fears: Arduino is no longer an open commons. It’s becoming just another corporate platform.</p><p>Here’s what’s at stake, what Qualcomm got wrong, and what might still be salvaged, drawing from community discussions across <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45984143\">maker</a><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45971039\">forums</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/qualcomms-buying-arduino-–-what-it-means-makers\">sites</a>.</p><p>The new terms read like standard corporate boilerplate: mandatory arbitration, data integration with Qualcomm’s global ecosystem, export controls, AI use restrictions. For any other SaaS platform, this would be unremarkable.</p><p>But Arduino isn’t SaaS. It’s the foundation of the maker ecosystem.</p><p>The most dangerous change is Arduino now explicitly states that using their platform grants you no patent licenses whatsoever. You can’t even argue one is implied.&nbsp;</p><p>This means Qualcomm could potentially assert patents against your projects if you built them using Arduino tools, Arduino examples, or Arduino-compatible hardware.</p><p>And here’s the disconnect, baffling makers. Arduino’s IDE is licensed under AGPL. Their CLI is GPL v3. Both licenses explicitly require that you can reverse engineer the software. But the new Qualcomm terms explicitly forbid reverse engineering “the Platform.”</p><p>The community is trying to figure out what is Qualcomm’s actual intent. Are these terms just bad lawyering with SaaS lawyers applying their standard template to cloud services, not realizing Arduino is different? Or is Qualcomm testing how much they can get away with before the community revolts? Or is this a first step toward locking down the ecosystem they just bought?</p><p>Some people point out that “the Platform” might only mean Arduino’s cloud services (forums, Arduino Cloud, Project Hub) not the IDE and CLI that everyone actually uses.</p><p>If that’s true, Qualcomm needs to say so, explicitly, and in plain language. Because library maintainers are likely wondering whether contributing to Arduino repos puts them at legal risk. And hardware makers are questioning whether “Arduino-compatible” is still safe to advertise.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why Adafruit’s alarm matters</strong>Adafruit has been vocal about the dangers of this acquisition. Some dismiss Adafruit’s criticism as self-serving. After all, they sell competing hardware and promote CircuitPython. But that misses who Adafruit is.</p><p>Adafruit has been the moral authority on open hardware for decades. They’ve made their living proving you can build a successful business on open principles. When they sound the alarm, it’s not about competition, it’s about principle.</p><p>What they’re calling out isn’t that Qualcomm bought Arduino. It’s that Qualcomm’s lawyers fundamentally don’t understand what they bought. Arduino wasn’t valuable because it was just a microcontroller company. It was valuable because it was a commons. And you can’t apply enterprise legal frameworks to a commons without destroying it.</p><p>Adafruit gets this. They’ve built their entire business on this. That’s why their criticism carries weight.</p><p><strong>What Qualcomm doesn’t seem to understand</strong>Qualcomm probably thought they were buying an IoT hardware company with a loyal user base.&nbsp;</p><p>They weren’t. They bought the IBM PC of the maker world.</p><p>Arduino’s value was never just the hardware. Their boards have been obsolete for years. Their value is the standard.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Arduino IDE is the lingua franca of hobby electronics.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Millions of makers learned on it, even if they moved to other hardware. ESP32, STM32, Teensy, Raspberry Pi Pico – none of them are Arduino hardware, but they all work with the Arduino IDE.</p><p>Thousands of libraries are “Arduino libraries.” Tutorials assume Arduino. University curricula teach Arduino. When you search “how to read a sensor,” the answer comes back in Arduino code.</p><p>This is the ecosystem Qualcomm’s lawyers just dropped legal uncertainty onto.</p><p>If Qualcomm’s lawyers start asserting control over the IDE, CLI, or core libraries under restrictive terms, they will poison the entire maker ecosystem. Even people who never buy Arduino hardware are dependent on Arduino software infrastructure.</p><p>Qualcomm didn’t just buy a company. They bought a commons. And now they inadvertently are taking steps that are destroying what made it valuable.</p><p><strong>What are makers supposed to do?</strong>There has been some buzz of folks just leaving the Arduino environment behind. But Arduino IDE alternatives such as PlatformIO and VSCode are not in any way beginner friendly. If the Arduino IDE goes, then there’s a huge problem.&nbsp;</p><p>I remember when Hypercard ended. There were alternatives, but none so easy. I don’t think I really coded again for almost 20 years until I picked up the Arduino IDE (go figure).</p><p>If something happens to the Arduino IDE, even if its development stalls or becomes encumbered, there’s no replacement for that easy onboarding. We’d lose many promising new makers because the first step became too steep.</p><p><strong>The institutional knowledge at risk</strong>But leaving Arduino behind isn’t simple. The platform’s success depends on two decades of accumulated knowledge, such as countless Arduino tutorials on YouTube, blogs, and school curricula; open-source libraries that depend on Arduino compatibility; projects in production using Arduino tooling; and university programs built around Arduino as the teaching platform</p><p>All of these depend on Arduino remaining open and accessible.</p><p>If Qualcomm decided to sunset the open Arduino IDE in favor of a locked-down “Arduino Pro” platform, or if they start asserting patent claims, or if uncertainty makes contributors abandon the ecosystem, all that knowledge becomes stranded.</p><p>It’s like Wikipedia going behind a paywall. The value isn’t just the content, it is the trust that it remains accessible. Arduino’s value isn’t just the code, it’s the trust that the commons would stay open.</p><p>That trust is now gone. And once lost, it hard to get back.</p><p><strong>Why this happened (but doesn’t excuse it</strong>)Let’s be fair to Qualcomm, their lawyers were doing their jobs.</p><p>When you acquire a company, you standardize the legal terms; add mandatory arbitration to limit class action exposure; integrate data systems for compliance and auditing; add export controls because you sell to defense contractors; prohibit reverse engineering because that’s in the template.</p><p>For most acquisitions, this is just good corporate hygiene. And Arduino, now part of a megacorp, faces higher liabilities than it did as an independent entity.</p><p>But here’s what Qualcomm’s lawyers missed: Arduino isn’t a normal acquisition. The community isn’t a customer base, it’s a commons. And you can’t apply enterprise SaaS legal frameworks to a commons without destroying what made it valuable.</p><p>This is tone-deafness, not malice. But the outcome is the same. A community that trusted Arduino no longer does.</p><p>Understanding why this happened doesn’t excuse it, but it might suggest what needs to happen next.</p><p><strong>What should have happened and how to still save it</strong>Qualcomm dropped legal boilerplate on the community with zero context and let people discover the contradictions themselves. That’s how you destroy trust overnight.</p><p>Qualcomm should have announced the changes in advance. They should have given the community weeks, not hours, to understand what’s changing and why. They should have used plain-language explanations, not just legal documents.</p><p>Qualcomm can fix things by explicitly carving out the open ecosystem. They should state clearly that the terms apply to Arduino Cloud services, and the IDE, CLI, and core libraries remain under their existing open source licenses.</p><p>We’d need concrete commitments, such as which repos stay open, which licenses won’t change, what’s protected from future acquisition decisions. Right now we have vague corporate-speak about “supporting the community.”&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, they could create some structural protection, as well, by putting IDE, CLI, and core libraries in a foundation that Qualcomm couldn’t unilaterally control (think the Linux Foundation model).</p><p>Finally, Qualcomm might wish to establish some form of community governance with real representation and real power over the tools the community depends on.</p><p>The acquisition is done. The legal integration is probably inevitable. But how it’s done determines whether Arduino survives as a commons or dies as just another Qualcomm subsidiary.</p><p>Arduino may be the toolset that made hobby electronics accessible to millions. But that maker community built Arduino into what it became. Qualcomm’s acquisition has thrown that legacy into doubt. Whether through legal confusion, corporate tone-deafness, or deliberate strategy, the community’s trust is broken.</p><p>The next few months will reveal whether this was a stumble or a strategy. If Qualcomm issues clarifications, moves repos to some sort of governance, and explicitly protects the open toolchain, then maybe this is salvageable. If they stay silent, or worse, if IDE development slows or license terms tighten further, then that’s a signal to find alternatives.&nbsp;</p><p>The question isn’t whether the open hobby electronics maker community survives. It’s whether Arduino does.</p>","contentLength":9413,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46005553"},{"title":"XBMC 4.0 for the Original Xbox","url":"https://www.xbox-scene.info/articles/announcing-xbmc-40-for-the-original-xbox-r64/","date":1763738285,"author":"zdw","guid":6168,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\n\tA new version of Xbox Media Center (XBMC),&nbsp;, has been released.&nbsp;This version marks a significant update to the long-standing media center platform for the Original Xbox. This marks the first major advancement to the software since 2016 and represents a renewed commitment to preserving, modernizing, and extending the capabilities of one of the most &nbsp;console homebrew applications ever created.\n</p><p>\n\tXBMC has a long and influential history. In 2002, XboxMediaPlayer (XMP) was released and turned the console into a powerful multimedia device fit for the living room in an era when connecting a computer to a TV was quite novel. Later that same year, XMP merged with YAMP and became Xbox Media Player 2.0. A few years later, the software evolved into Xbox Media Center, or XBMC, which introduced a new interface, a plugin system powered by Python, and a robust skinning engine.\n</p><p>\n\tXBMC eventually became so capable that it outgrew the Xbox entirely. By 2007, developers were working on PC ports and in 2010, the project split into two branches: one for general computers while the Xbox version became , and each codebase was maintained from then on by separate teams. XBMC was later renamed to <a href=\"https://kodi.tv/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Kodi</a> in 2014 and continues to be one of the most popular media center applications available. Even <a href=\"https://www.plex.tv/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Plex</a> traces its roots back to XBMC. Plex began as , a Mac port of XBMC in late 2007, before becoming its own project in 2008. This means the Original Xbox helped shape not one but  of the biggest media center apps used today.\n</p><p>\n\tThe last official release of XBMC4Xbox arrived in <a href=\"https://www.xbmc4xbox.org.uk/2016/02/xbmc4xbox-3-5-3-is-out/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">February 2016</a> with version 3.5.3. Although the community never declared the project dead, meaningful updates became scarce. XBMC 4.0 continues that legacy by bringing a modern interface, updating it to be more inline with Kodi's modern codebase, and backporting features to the original 64MB RAM / Pentium-III hardware where it all began.\n</p><p>\n\tThis project is distinct and separate from <a href=\"https://github.com/Rocky5/XBMC4Gamers\" rel=\"external nofollow\">XBMC4Gamers</a>, the games-focused variation of XBMC4Xbox (v3.5.3) by developer Rocky5.\n</p><h2>\n\tA Modern Interface Powered by Estuary\n</h2><p>\n\tOne of the most notable advancements in XBMC 4.0 is the introduction of the  user interface (skin).\n</p><p>\n\tEstuary, originally released in 2017 with Kodi v17 (\"<a href=\"https://kodi.wiki/view/Archive:Kodi_v17_(Krypton)_changelog\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Krypton</a>\"), provides a clean and modern layout that improves navigation and readability over past skins. Bringing Estuary to the Xbox required extensive updates to the underlying GUI framework, including a port of the more contemporary  engine. This allows the platform to support modern skinning standards and makes future skin ports much more straightforward. After the initial work of porting GUIlib was done, porting Estuary to the Xbox was a relatively simple process of tweaking a handful of configuration files and adding contextual features specific to the Xbox. The result is a modern, intuitive front end that retains the performance and responsiveness required on legacy hardware.\n</p><p>\n\tFiring up an Xbox made in 2001 and being greeted by the same interface as what you'd find if you were to download Kodi today onto your PC feels like a bit of magic, and helps keep this beloved classic console relevant and useful well into the modern era.\n</p><h2>\n\tExpanded Games Library Support\n</h2><p>\n\tXBMC 4.0 introduces a fully realized games library system. This enhancement brings the same level of metadata support found in the Movies and Music sections to Xbox and emulated games. Titles can now display artwork, descriptions, and other metadata, transforming the games section into a polished and user-friendly library. XBMC’s longstanding support for trainers remains intact, giving users the option to apply gameplay modifications for compatible titles. Emulated game collections benefit as well, with the ability to browse ROM libraries and launch them directly in a user’s preferred emulator.\n</p><h2>\n\tOnline Scrapers and Metadata Support\n</h2><p>\n\tXBMC 4.0 restores full functionality to metadata scrapers for movies and television. This allows users to build rich media libraries complete with artwork, plot summaries, cast listings, and other information retrieved directly from online sources. XBMC 4.0 handles these tasks efficiently, even on the Xbox’s limited memory and processing power. Video playback continues to support 480p and 720p content, enabling the console to serve as a surprisingly capable media device for its age. Similar to Kodi, XBMC 4.0 supports filtering, building playlists, watch progress history for media, and intelligent handling of TV shows with seasons.\n</p><p>\n\tAside from scrapers for multimedia, support for rich library capabilities for games has also been added. XBMC has always been a media-first app, and now users can enjoy the library experience that they've come to love for media now in the context of their games library .\n</p><h2>\n\tImproved Task Scheduling and Multitasking\n</h2><p>\n\tDespite the constraints of the Xbox’s single-threaded 733MHz CPU, XBMC 4.0 includes improvements to task scheduling that allow multiple activities to run concurrently. Background library updates, metadata scraping, and audio/video playback can occur while users navigate and use other parts of the interface. These optimizations help ensure a fluid experience without compromising performance. Much work has been done \"under the hood\" to keep XBMC on task and within memory budgets while achieving multi-tasking on a console that wasn't exactly designed with it in mind. Users who own RAM and/or CPU upgraded consoles can also take advantage of the extra overhead, as XBMC 4.0 makes use of the extra horsepower for an even smoother experience. Utilizing an SSD with higher UDMA speeds will also yield an improvement in overall responsiveness.\n</p><h2>\n\tMusic Experience and Visualizers\n</h2><p>\n\tMusic playback has always been a strong element of XBMC, and version 4.0 maintains that focus. The Original Xbox is capable of high quality audio output, and XBMC continues to support lossless codecs such as FLAC. The release includes compatibility with various audio visualizers, including MilkDrop, which remains one of the most visually impressive and customizable audio visualization engines available. These features allow XBMC 4.0 to function not only as a media organizer, but also as an immersive audio display system.\n</p><p>\n\tAn online repository has been established and will be maintained moving forward where users can download legacy and newly-released&nbsp;add-ons as they become available. This repository is&nbsp;accessible without additional setup, right out of the box!\n</p><h2>\n\tAdd-ons and Python Support\n</h2><p>\n\tXBMC 4.0 continues to offer an extendable architecture powered by Python-based add-ons. While the current release uses Python 2.7 for compatibility, work is underway to transition to Python 3.4.10 in the future, which may provide a path for backporting many newer Kodi add-ons. Even in its current state, XBMC 4.0 already supports a variety of community-developed add-ons that extend the system’s functionality, including tools for online video playback (i.e. YouTube), online weather services, and enhanced media organization.\n</p><h2>\n\tUpdated Settings, Network Services, and System Tools\n</h2><p>\n\tThe settings interface has been revised to provide more clarity and control. The update includes:\n</p><ul><li><p>\n\t\t\tPlayback options, including episode progression, crossfade behavior, and subtitle handling\n\t\t</p></li><li><p>\n\t\t\tNetwork features, such as SMB, FTP, UPnP sharing, web server access, and Insignia-compatible DNS options\n\t\t</p></li><li><p>\n\t\t\tComprehensive interface customization options\n\t\t</p></li><li><p>\n\t\t\tMultiple user profiles with individual library settings\n\t\t</p></li><li><p>\n\t\t\tAdvanced system controls for video calibration, display modes, input devices, and power management\n\t\t</p></li><li><p>\n\t\t\tA robust System Information section for diagnostics, with info geared towards the Original Xbox\n\t\t</p></li><li><p>\n\t\t\tA flexible File Manager with support for network protocols including FTP, SMB, WebDAV, and more\n\t\t</p></li></ul><p>\n\tUsers may also take advantage of an online add-ons repository, offering the same experience modern Kodi provides with being able to download add-ons to extend functionality of the app with things like online multimedia providers, weather, skins, visualizers, and more. Developers can submit new add-ons to the official repository via <a href=\"https://github.com/xbmc4xbox/xbmc4xbox.github.io\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Github</a>.\n</p><p>\n\tXBMC has been a staple of the Original Xbox's homebrew scene since its inception in the early 2000's. This new update is a revival of the platform that helped shape the landscape of home media software and helps revitalize a codebase that has been somewhat stagnant for many years. This release honors that heritage while modernizing the experience for a new generation of enthusiasts and preserving the functionality of the Original Xbox as a versatile and capable media center.\n</p><p>\n\tAlthough the hardware is decades old, the renewed effort behind XBMC 4.0 demonstrates that the platform still has room to grow and tricks up its sleeve. With ongoing development and a codebase designed with modern Kodi compatibility in mind, XBMC 4.0 represents a significant step forward into the continued development on the Original Xbox.\n</p><p>\n\tThe development team looks forward to continuing this work and expanding the possibilities of the Original Xbox for years to come. This version is the first of many to come, with lots of things cooking in the background. Keep an eye out for future releases by joining the  and turning on notifications in the  channel or by periodically checking the project's Github page.\n</p><p>\n\tXBMC 4.0 (and subsequent releases) builds along with source code are available via Github:\n</p><p><em>Note: XBMC 4.0 is is in active development!

Subsequent compromises from each, like\n<a href=\"https://www.wiz.io/blog/shai-hulud-npm-supply-chain-attack\">Shai-Hulud</a>, represent  windows of opportunity where the attackers regrouped\nand pivoted onto the  set of compromised credentials.)</p><p>My takeaway from this: some windows of opportunity are bigger, but the \nof them are under a week long. Consequently, ordinary developers can  of these types of attacks by instituting  on their dependencies.</p><p>A “cooldown” is exactly what it sounds like: a window of time between when a dependency\nis published and when it’s considered suitable for use.

Setting a cooldown of 7 days would have prevented\nthe vast majority of these attacks from reaching end users (and causing\nknock-on attacks, which several of these were). Increasing the cooldown to 14\ndays would have prevented all but 1 of these attacks.</p><p>Cooldowns are, obviously, : some attackers  evade detection,\nand delaying the inclusion of potentially malicious dependencies by a week\n(or two) does not fundamentally alter the fact that supply chain security is a\n problem, not a purely technical one. Still, an 80-90% reduction\nin exposure through a technique that is free and easy seems hard to beat.</p><p>Related to the above, it’s unfortunate that cooldowns aren’t baked \ninto more packaging ecosystems: Dependabot and Renovate are great, but\n would be if the package manager itself (as the source of ground\ntruth) could enforce cooldowns directly (including of dependencies not\nintroduced or bumped through automated flows).</p>","contentLength":4397,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46005111"},{"title":"Making a Small RPG","url":"https://jslegenddev.substack.com/p/making-a-small-rpg","date":1763731396,"author":"ibobev","guid":6158,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46004293"},{"title":"How a French judge was digitally cut off by the USA","url":"https://www.heise.de/en/news/How-a-French-judge-was-digitally-cut-off-by-the-USA-11087561.html","date":1763727161,"author":"i-con","guid":6085,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Digital sovereignty has been much discussed in Europe in recent weeks, most recently <a href=\"https://www.heise.de/news/Souveraenitaetsgipfel-Merz-und-Macron-proben-den-Schulterschluss-11083979.html?from-en=1\">during a German-French summit in Berlin</a>.

The USA condemned this decision by the court, whereupon the US Treasury Department sanctioned six judges and three prosecutors.</p><h3>Digitally excluded from almost everything</h3><p>In Guillou's daily life, this means that he is excluded from digital life and much of what is considered standard today, he told the <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2025/11/19/nicolas-guillou-juge-francais-de-la-cpi-sanctionne-par-les-etats-unis-face-aux-attaques-les-magistrats-de-la-cour-tiendront_6654016_3210.html\" rel=\"external noopener\" target=\"_blank\">French newspaper Le Monde</a>. All his accounts with US companies such as Amazon, Airbnb, or PayPal were immediately closed by the providers. Online bookings, such as through Expedia, are immediately canceled, even if they concern hotels in France. Participation in e-commerce is also practically no longer possible for him, as US companies always play a role in one way or another, and they are strictly forbidden to enter into any trade relationship with sanctioned individuals.</p><p>He also describes the impact on participating in banking as drastic. Payment systems are blocked for him, as US companies like American Express, Visa, and Mastercard have a virtual monopoly in Europe. He also describes the rest of banking as severely restricted. For example, accounts with non-US banks have also been partially closed. Transactions in US dollars or via dollar conversions are forbidden to him.</p><h3>Judge: EU should block sanctions</h3><p>Guillou's case shows how strong the USA's influence in the tech sector is and how few options he has to circumvent it. And this at a time when an account with a US tech company is considered a matter of course in more and more places.</p><p>The French judge advocates for Europe to gain more sovereignty in the digital and banking sectors. Without this sovereignty, the rule of law cannot be guaranteed, he warns. At the same time, he calls on the EU to activate <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31996R2271\" rel=\"external noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an existing blocking regulation </a>(Regulation (EC) No 2271/96) for the International Criminal Court, which prevents third countries like the USA from enforcing sanctions in the EU. EU companies would then no longer be allowed to comply with US sanctions if they violate EU interests.

Having some time off from work this week, I\ntried to implement <a href=\"https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/22\">one of the problems</a>\nin it to get some practice, set up my tooling, see how hard AWK would be,\nand… I found I’m FP-pilled.</p><p>I  I’m addicted to the combination of algebraic data types (tagged unions)\nand exhaustive pattern matching, but what got me this time was immutability,\nlexical scope and the basic human right of being allowed to return arrays from\nfunctions.</p><p>Part 1 of the Advent of Code problem was easy enough, but for part 2 (basically\na shortest path search with a twist, to not spoil too much), I found myself\nunable to switch from my usual <a href=\"https://martin.janiczek.cz/2023/06/27/fp-pattern-list-of-todos.html\">functional BFS\napproach</a>\nto something mutable, and ended up trying to implement my functional approach in\nAWK.</p><p>It got hairy very fast: I needed to implement:</p><ul><li>hashing of strings and 2D arrays (by piping to )</li><li>a global  array of seen states</li><li>a way to serialize and deserialize a 2D array to/from a string</li><li>and a few associative arrays for retrieving this serialized array by its\nhash.</li></ul><p>I was very lost by the time I had all this; I spent hours just solving what felt\nlike ; things that I’d take for granted in more modern\nlanguages.</p><p>Now, I know nobody said AWK is modern, or functional, or that it promises any\nconvenience for anything other than one-liners and basic scripts that fit under\na handful of lines. I don’t want to sound like I expect AWK to do any of this;\nI knew I was stretching the tool when going in. But I couldn’t shake the feeling\nthat there’s a beautiful AWK-like language within reach, an iteration on the AWK\ndesign (the pattern-action way of thinking is beautiful) that also gives us a\nfew of the things programming language designers have learnt over the 48 years\nsince AWK was born.</p><h2>Dreaming of functional AWK</h2><p>Stopping my attempts to solve the AoC puzzle in pure AWK, I wondered: what am I\nmissing here?</p><p>What if AWK had </p><pre><code>BEGIN {\n  # array literals\n  normal   = [1, 2, 3]\n  nested   = [[1,2], [3,4]]\n  assoc    = [\"foo\" =&gt; \"bar\", \"baz\" =&gt; \"quux\"]\n  multidim = [(1,\"abc\") =&gt; 999]\n\n  five = range(1,5)\n  analyze(five)\n  print five  # --&gt; still [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]! was passed by value\n}\n\nfunction range(a,b) {\n  r = []\n  for (i = a; i &lt;= b; i++) {\n    r[length(r)] = i\n  }\n  return r  # arrays can be returned!\n}\n\nfunction analyze(arr) {\n  arr[0] = 100\n  print arr[0]  # --&gt; 100, only within this function\n}\n</code></pre><p>What if AWK had <strong>first-class functions and lambdas?</strong></p><pre><code>BEGIN {\n  # construct anonymous functions\n  double = (x) =&gt; { x * 2 }\n  add = (a, b) =&gt; { c = a + b; return c }\n\n  # functions can be passed as values\n  apply = (func, value) =&gt; { func(value) }\n\n  print apply(double,add(1,3))  # --&gt; 8\n  print apply(inc,5)  # --&gt; 6\n}\n\nfunction inc(a) { return a + 1 }\n</code></pre><p>What if AWK had  instead of dynamic scope?</p><pre><code># No need for this hack anymore ↓     ↓\n#function foo(a, b         ,local1, local2) {\nfunction foo(a, b) {\n  local1 = a + b\n  local2 = a - b\n  return local1 + local2\n}\n\nBEGIN {\n  c = foo(1,2)\n  print(local1)  # --&gt; 0, the local1 from foo() didn't leak!\n}\n</code></pre><p>What if AWK had , and everything else was </p><pre><code>BEGIN { global count }\nEND {\n  foo()\n  print count  # --&gt; 1\n  print mylocal # --&gt; 0, didn't leak\n}\nfunction foo() { count++; mylocal++ }\n</code></pre><p>(This one, admittedly, might make programs a bit more verbose.

I didn’t want to spend days\nimplementing AWK from scratch or tweaking somebody else’s implementation. So I\ntried to use Cursor Agent for a larger task than I usually do (I tend to ask\nfor very small targeted edits), and asked Sonnet 4.5 for <a href=\"https://github.com/Janiczek/fawk/pull/1/files\">a README with code\nexamples</a>, and then <a href=\"https://github.com/Janiczek/fawk/pull/2/files\">a full\nimplementation in Python</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Note: I also asked for implementations in C, Haskell and Rust at the same\ntime, not knowing if any of the four would succeed, and they all seem to have\nproduced code that at least compiles/runs.

The PRs are\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Janiczek/fawk/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">here</a>.</p></blockquote><p>I was very impressed—I still am! I expected the LLM to stumble and flail\naround and ultimately get nothing done, but it did what I asked it for (gave me\nan interpreter that could run ), and over the course\nof a few chat sessions, I guided it towards implementing more and more of “the\nrest of AWK”, together with an excessive amount of end-to-end tests.</p><p>The only time I could see it struggle was when I asked it to implement arbitrary\nprecision floating point operations without using an external library like\n.

In a moment it was done.</p><p>Other things that I thought it would choke on, like  being both a\nstatement (with  and  redirection support) and an expression, or\nmulti-dimensional arrays, or multi-line records, these were all implemented\ncorrectly. Updating the test suite to also check for backwards compatibility\nwith <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/\">GAWK</a> - not an issue.

I\ndidn’t expect to have a working interpreter  I dreamt of a new\nprogramming language. It now seems possible.</p><p>The downside of vibe coding the whole interpreter is that I have zero knowledge\nof the code. I only interacted with the agent by telling it to implement a\nthing and write tests for it, and I only  reviewed the tests. I reckon\nthis would be an issue in the future when I want to manually make some change\nin the actual code, because I have no familiarity with it.</p><blockquote><p>This also opened new questions for me wrt. my other projects where I’ve\npreviously run out of steam, eg. trying to implement a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system\">Hindley-Milner type\nsystem</a> for my\ndream forever-WIP programming language <a href=\"https://cara-lang.com/\">Cara</a>.

I want\nto be familiar with and able to tinker on the code. I’d need to spend my time\nreviewing and reading code instead of writing everything myself. Perhaps that’s\nOK.</p></blockquote><p>Performance of FAWK might be an issue as well, though right now it’s a non-goal,\ngiven my intended use case is throwaway scripts for Advent of Code, nothing\nuser-facing.

Achieving strong results in programming, reading comprehension, and math problem solving, Olmo 3-Base maintains performance at extended context lengths (~up to 65K tokens)—providing a versatile foundation for continued pretraining, targeted fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning and making it easy to build in specialized capabilities like reasoning, tool use (function calling), and instruction following through post-training.</li><li>is our flagship post-trained reasoning set built on Olmo 3-Base.

Each path is a concrete example of how to shape behavior from the same base model, and you’re free to fork or remix them—start with Olmo 3-Base, explore your own supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or direct preference optimization (DPO) recipe for instruct-style use cases, or plug in a new RL objective to probe different tradeoffs.

Pretraining runs in three stages—an initial large-scale training run that builds broad capabilities; a mid-training phase that focuses on harder material like math, code, and reading comprehension; and a final long-context extension stage that trains the model on very long documents. Together with architectural enhancements, this yields a more capable, efficient base for the Olmo 3 family.</p><p>Post-training then specializes the pretrained model for different use cases. Building on Olmo 2, each pathway follows a three-stage recipe – SFT, preference tuning with DPO, and RLVR – but in Olmo 3, we expose this as a fully documented model flow with complete customization over each training stage and dataset mix.</p><p>Instead of releasing only the final weights, we provide checkpoints from each major training milestone: the base pretrained model, the mid-trained model after targeted skill enhancement, the long-context-extended version, plus post-training checkpoints for the Olmo 3-Think, Olmo 3-Instruct, and Olmo 3-RL Zero flows. You can study how capabilities emerge over time, run ablations on specific stages, and fork the model at whatever point best fits your data, compute, and goals.</p><p>Compared to Olmo 2, we scaled data collection and significantly strengthened our dataset curation methods. Continuing our commitment to full transparency, we’re releasing several new, higher-quality datasets that cover every stage of base model training and post-training—from initial learning to specialized skills like complex reasoning and long-context understanding. This means anyone can see exactly what data shaped the model’s capabilities, reproduce our results, and reuse these datasets to train their own AI systems.</p><p>Olmo 3 is pretrained on , a new ~9.3-trillion-token corpus drawn from web pages, science PDFs processed with <a data-current=\"false\" href=\"https://olmocr.allenai.org/\"></a>, codebases, math problems and solutions, and encyclopedic text. From this pool, we construct , a 5.9-trillion-token (~6T) pretraining mix with a higher proportion of coding and mathematical data than earlier Dolma releases, plus much stronger decontamination via extensive deduplication, quality filtering, and careful control over data mixing. We follow established web standards in collecting training data and don’t collect from sites that explicitly disallow it, including paywalled content.</p><p>On top of this, we introduce two Dolma 3-based mixes for later stages of base model training. is our mid-training mix: 100B training tokens sampled from a ~2.2T-token pool of high-quality math, science, code, instruction-following, and reading-comprehension data, including reasoning traces that also enable RL directly on the base model.  is our long-context mix: ~50B training tokens drawn from a 639B-token pool of long documents combined with mid-training data to teach Olmo 3 to track information over very long inputs (like reports, logs, and multi-chapter documents).</p><p>We also introduce , a new post-training data suite tailored specifically for reasoning, tool use, and instruction following. Dolci provides separate mixes for each stage of post-training: SFT, DPO, and RLVR. For SFT, Dolci aggregates state-of-the-art datasets that advance step-by-step reasoning, tool use, and high-quality conversational behavior; for DPO, it supplies high-quality contrastive preference data; and for RL, it includes hard, diverse prompts across math, coding, instruction following, and general chat.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, Dolma 3 and Dolci give Olmo 3 a fully open data curriculum from first token to final post-trained checkpoint.</p><p>We pretrained Olmo 3 on a cluster of up to 1,024 H100 GPUs; we achieved training throughput of 7.7K tokens per device per second for Olmo 3-Base (7B). We mid-trained on 128 H100 GPUs, and post-trained on a set of 256 H100s.</p><p>For Olmo 3, building on the work we did for Olmo 2, we were able to significantly improve the efficiency of our post-training code. By moving SFT from Open Instruct (our post-training codebase, prioritizing flexibility) to Olmo Core (our pretraining codebase, designed to maximize efficiency), we increased throughput (tokens/second) by 8x. Similarly, by incorporating <a data-current=\"false\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19128\"></a>, <a data-current=\"false\" href=\"https://www.anyscale.com/blog/continuous-batching-llm-inference\"></a>, and a lot of threading improvements, we made our RL training 4x more efficient—resulting in training runs that are significantly cheaper and faster.&nbsp;</p><div><div><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><th>inflight updates (Olmo 3)</th></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><p>A note on our 32B models: We believe 32B sits in a sweet spot for research and tinkering. 32B models are big enough to support strong, competitive performance, but still small enough that a wide audience can fine-tune and deploy them on accessible hardware.</p><p>A core goal of Olmo 3 is not just to  the model flow, but to make it  for people who want to understand and improve model behavior. Olmo 3 integrates with <a data-current=\"false\" href=\"https://allenai.org/blog/olmotrace\"></a>, our tool for tracing model outputs back to training data in real time.</p><p>For example, in the Ai2 Playground, you can ask Olmo 3-Think (32B) to answer a general-knowledge question, then use OlmoTrace to inspect where and how the model may have learned to generate parts of its response.

That growth was supercharged during the COVID-19 pandemic when extended closures and bumbled remote learning drove many families to experiment with teaching their own kids. The big question was whether the end of public health controls would also curtail interest in homeschooling. We know now that it didn't. Americans' taste for DIY education is on the rise.</p><p>\"In the 2024-2025 school year, homeschooling continued to grow across the United States, increasing at an average rate of 5.4%,\" Angela Watson of the Johns Hopkins University School of Education's Homeschool Hub <a href=\"https://education.jhu.edu/edpolicy/policy-research-initiatives/homeschool-hub/homeschool-growth-2024-2025/\">wrote</a> earlier this month. \"This is nearly three times the pre-pandemic homeschooling growth rate of around 2%.\" She added that more than a third of the states from which data is available report their highest homeschooling numbers ever, even exceeding the peaks reached when many public and private schools were closed during the pandemic.</p><p>After COVID-19 public health measures were suspended, there was a brief drop in homeschooling as parents and families returned to old habits. That didn't last long. Homeschooling began <a href=\"https://education.jhu.edu/edpolicy/policy-research-initiatives/homeschool-hub/homeschool-growth-2023-2024/\">surging again in the 2023-2024 school year</a>, with that growth continuing last year. Based on numbers from 22 states (not all states have released data, and many don't track homeschoolers), four report declines in the ranks of homeschooled children—Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, and Tennessee—while the others report growth from around 1 percent (Florida and Louisiana) to as high as 21.5 percent (South Carolina).</p><p>The latest figures likely underestimate growth in homeschooling since not all DIY families abide by registration requirements where they exist, and because families who use the portable funding available through increasingly popular <a href=\"https://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/education-savings-account/\">Education Savings Accounts</a> to pay for homeschooling costs are not counted as homeschoolers in several states, Florida included. As a result, adds Watson, \"we consider these counts as the minimum number of homeschooled students in each state.\"</p><p>Recent estimates put the total homeschooling population at about <a href=\"https://www.educationnext.org/new-u-s-census-bureau-data-confirm-growth-in-homeschooling-amid-pandemic/\">6 percent of students</a> across the United States, compared to about 3 percent pre-pandemic. Continued growth necessarily means the share of DIY-educated students is increasing. That's quite a change for an education approach that was decidedly not mainstream just a generation ago.</p><p>\"This isn't a pandemic hangover; it's a fundamental shift in how American families are thinking about education,\" comments Watson.</p><p>Homeschooling is a major beneficiary of changing education preferences among American families, but it's not the only one.</p><p>\"Five years after the pandemic's onset, there has been a substantial shift away from public schools and toward non-public options,\" Boston University's Joshua Goodman and Abigail Francis <a href=\"https://www.educationnext.org/school-enrollment-shifts-five-years-after-pandemic-public-education-shrinking-middle-schools/\">wrote</a> last summer for . Looking at Massachusetts—not the friendliest regulatory environment for alternatives to traditional public schooling—they found that as the state's school-age population shrank by 2.6 percent since 2019, there has been a 4.2 percent decline in local public-school enrollment, a 0.7 decline in private-school enrollment, and a 56 percent increase in homeschooling. \"Charter school enrollment is flat, due in part to regulatory limitations in Massachusetts,\" they added.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/declining-public-school-enrollment/\">research</a> published in August, Dylan Council, Sofoklis Goulas, and Faidra Monachou of the Brookings Institution found similar results at the national level. \"The COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of families to rethink where and how their children learn, and the effects continue to reshape American K-12 education,\" they observed. If \"parents keep choosing alternatives at the pace observed since 2020, traditional public schools could lose as many as 8.5 million students, shrinking from 43.06 million in 2023-24 to as few as 34.57 million by mid-century.\"</p><p>It's not difficult to figure out what pushes parents to seek out alternatives and to flock to the various forms of DIY education grouped under the homeschooling heading.</p><p>\"The fraction of parents saying K-12 education is heading in the wrong direction was fairly stable from 2019 to 2022 but rose in 2023 and then again in 2024 to its highest level in a decade, suggesting continuing or even growing frustration with schools,\" commented Goodman and Francis.</p><p>Specifically, EdChoice's <a href=\"https://www.edchoice.org/schooling-in-america-survey-dashboard/\">Schooling in America survey</a> puts the percentage of school parents saying that K-12 education is headed in the right direction at 41 percent—down from 48 percent in 2022 (the highest score recorded). Fifty-nine percent say K-12 education is on the wrong track—up from 52 percent in 2021 (the lowest score recorded).</p><p>When asked if they are <a href=\"https://www.edchoice.org/schooling-in-america-survey-dashboard/\">satisfied with their children's education</a>, public school parents consistently rank last after parents who choose private schools, homeschooling, and charter schools. Importantly, among all parents of school-age children, homeschooling enjoys a 70 percent favorability rating.</p><p>The reasons for the move away from public schools certainly vary from family to family, but there have been notable developments in recent years. During the pandemic, many parents discovered that their preferences regarding school closures and health policies were <a href=\"https://x.com/DeAngelisCorey/status/1787486168637952038\">anything  a priority</a> for educators.</p><p>Closures also gave parents a chance to experience public schools' competence with remote learning, and many were <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jdfedtransformer/are-you-a-parent-who-is-frustrated-by-remote-learning-ec616738eae7\">unimpressed</a>. They have also been unhappy with the <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/01/31/years-after-the-pandemic-the-lowest-performing-students-are-still-significantly-behind/\">poor quality</a> and <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-politics-are-straining-parent-school-relationships/2022/02\">often politicized lessons</a> taught to their children that infuriatingly blend declining learning outcomes with indoctrination. That doesn't mean parents all want the same things, but the one-size-fits-some nature of public schooling make curriculum battles inevitable—and push many towards the exits in favor of alternatives including, especially, homeschooling. The shift appears to be here to stay.</p><p>\"What's particularly striking is the resilience of this trend,\" concludes Watson of Johns Hopkins University's Homeschool Hub. \"States that saw declines have bounced back with double-digit growth, and we're seeing record enrollment numbers across the country.\"</p><p>Once an alternative way to educate children, homeschooling is now an increasingly popular and mainstream option.</p>","contentLength":6428,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45999842"},{"title":"Prozac 'no better than placebo' for treating children with depression, experts","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/20/prozac-no-better-than-placebo-for-treating-children-with-depression-experts-say","date":1763683338,"author":"pseudolus","guid":6131,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Clinical guidelines should no longer recommend Prozac for children, according to experts, after <a href=\"https://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356%2825%2900349-X/fulltext\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">research showed</a> it had no clinical benefit for treating depression in children and adolescents.</p><p>But a new review of trial data by academics in Austria and the UK concluded that fluoxetine, sold under the brand name of Prozac among others, is clinically no better than placebo drugs in treating depression in children, and should therefore no longer be prescribed to them.</p><p>The authors conducted a meta analysis of 12 large trials involving Prozac, published between 1997 and 2024, and concluded that fluoxetine improved children’s depressive symptoms so little as to not be considered clinically meaningful.</p><p>“Consider the analogy of a weight-loss drug that is better than placebo at producing weight loss, but the difference is only 100 grams,” said Martin Plöderl, a clinical psychologist at Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg, Austria, and lead author of the study. “This difference is unlikely to be noticeable to the patient or their doctors or produce any difference in their overall condition.”</p><p>The study, published in the <a href=\"https://www.jclinepi.com/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</a>, identified a “novelty bias” in early trials, which were likely to be more positive, while later studies fail to confirm these effects.

Now I’m working on carbon removal + steel at <a href=\"https://charmindustrial.com/\">Charm Industrial</a>, and electric long-haul trucking with <a href=\"https://revoy.com\">Revoy</a>. It’s epically fun to be building in the real world, but little did I expect that more than half the cost of building a hardware company would come from regulatory bottlenecks. Despite a huge push for climate fixes and the bipartisan geopolitical desire to bring industry back to the USA, I’ve been shocked to find that the single biggest barrier—by far—is over-regulation from the massive depth of bureaucracy.</p><p>Hardtech companies of all flavors are being forced to burn through limited capital while they wait for regulatory clarity and/or permits. This creates a constant cycle of cost increases that ultimately flows to consumers, it lowers investment in the US manufacturing and industrial base, it delays innovative new hardware getting into the hands of consumers and businesses, and at the end of the day, it leaves us all worse off, stuck with a quality of life pegged to technology developed decades ago. </p><p>Regulatory delays and bottlenecks have added millions of pounds of pollutants like PM2.5, NOₓ and CO₂ to our air from the continuation of business as usual, instead of the deployment of clean technologies from my two hardtech efforts alone. While CO₂ is a long-term climate issue, PM2.5 and NOₓ are immediate major drivers of asthma and excess morbidity. Both operations have high bipartisan appeal—and we’ve never been denied a permit—because we’re fundamentally cleaning up things that matter to everyone: dirty air, wildfires, orphaned oil wells. Revoy is also helping deflate the cost of long-haul freight. But none of that has made getting freedom to operate easy. For creative new technologies the default answer is “no” because there isn’t a clear path to permitting at all, and figuring out that path itself takes years — time that startups can’t afford to wait.</p><p>Regulation obviously has a critical role in protecting people and the environment, but the sheer volume, over-specificity and sometimes ambiguity of those same regulations is now actively working against those goals! We’re unintentionally blocking the very things that would improve our environment. We’ve become a society that blocks all things, and we need to be a society that builds great things every day. The rest of this article gets very specific about the astronomical costs regulations are imposing on us as a society, and the massive positive impact that could be unleashed by cutting back regulation that is working against new, cost-saving, creative technology that could also be making people and the environment healthy again.</p><p>To make it concrete: both Charm and Revoy are capital-efficient hardtech companies, but Charm will spend low hundreds of millions to get to breakeven, and Revoy will spend tens of millions. In both cases, more than half of the total cost of building each company has gone to counterproductive regulatory burden. I’m hellbent on pushing through these barriers, but the unspoken reality is that our regulatory morass is the deathbed of thousands of hardtech companies that could be drastically improving our lives. We must unleash them.</p><h2>$300M in Societal Cost &amp; $125M in Burden for Charm</h2><p>Charm produces and delivers verified carbon removal to companies like Google, Microsoft and JPMorgan. Charm’s breakthrough was realizing that you could take CO₂ captured in farm &amp; forestry plant residues, convert it into a carbon-rich, BBQ sauce-like liquid (it’s literally the smoke flavor in BBQ sauce), and inject it into old oil wells to permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere. This has all kinds of co-benefits like reducing the massive overburden of wildfire fuels, cleaning up &amp; plugging nasty orphaned oil wells, and improving PM2.5 and NOₓ air quality by avoiding that biomass being burned instead.</p><p>And yet… there was a hangup: what kind of injection well is this? Should it be permitted as a Class I disposal, Class II oilfield disposal, or Class V experimental? This question on permitting path took four years to answer. Four years to decide which path to use, not even the actual permit! It took this long because regulators are structurally faced with no upside, only downside legal risk in taking a formal position on something new. Even when we’d done an enormous amount of lab and field work with bio-oil to understand its safety and behavior at surface and subsurface conditions. A regulator faces little cost to moving incredibly cautiously, but a major cost if they approve something that triggers activist pushback.</p><p>In the end, we’re grateful that—eventually—a state regulator took the reins and reviewed, managed, and issued the first-ever Class V bio-oil sequestration permit, through what was still an incredibly complex and detailed 14-month review process.</p><p>Now imagine that, instead of the 5.5 years from first contact to issued permit, it had only taken the 6 months it actually required to get everyone across the regulatory establishment to agree on a Class V pathway, we would have had 5 additional years operating the well. That’s the equivalent, from our real supply chain, of sinking at least 30,000 tonnes of carbon per year at $600/tonne. Looking only at this one aspect, this delay came with a $90M price tag for Charm. We’ve also spent untold millions on regulatory affairs at all levels of government, not to mention the missed acceleration in sales, and other direct hard costs spent in R&amp;D and processing bio-oil for inefficient and expensive injection into salt caverns instead.</p><p>But the public health burden created by this regulatory slowness is where it gets really crazy. This one regulatory delay meant we all got subjected to decreased air quality from an additional 30,000 tonnes per year of pile burning. The resulting particulate emissions alone are estimated to have caused a mindblowing $40m/year in healthcare costs. This is $200M in additional healthcare burden over those five years, mostly borne by Medicare and Medicaid. There are additional costs to NOₓ emissions and more that take it to $300M.</p><p>In total, the total cost to society of this single regulatory delay will be about $400M: $120-150M of unnecessary cost to Charm, and the bulk of it—$300M or so—borne by the public in healthcare costs. I’m not sharing these numbers to complain or make excuses; Charm is still on the path to having a huge impact and we’re among the lucky few that can survive these delays. What pains me most is the 5 years of lost carbon removal and pollutant reduction, and the compounding effect that has on all our health and healthcare costs. Over-regulation is now working against the very things it’s intended to protect.</p><p>Regulators do their absolute best with the system they have, but the combined effects of: (1) extremely detailed and complex regulation, (2) chaotic budgets and understaffing that disrupt an efficient process, and (3) endless lawsuits against regulators since 1970s-era Naderism have created an atmosphere of fear. If we want to solve the climate crisis, build abundance, lower costs, and generate wealth for all, this has to change. We need to delete and simplify reams of regulations. We need to pay regulators well, and we need to trust our regulators to operate quickly and decisively by putting reasonable limits on endless activist legal challenges.</p><h2>&gt;$25M in Unnecessary Burden for Revoy</h2><p>Revoy’s breakthrough was realizing that you could lower long-haul freight costs and electrify long-haul semi trucks by leaving the diesel tractor in place and dropping an electric powertrain onto the back of the semi. Today, we boost semis from 7 mpg to 120 mpg, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterreinhardt_with-revoy-the-engine-is-barely-sipping-now-activity-7371890462858792960-Vd4C?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAMMp6QB1zwW5lEhjgdL13vCKsLStbaJawY\">driving a 94% reduction in fuel consumption</a>. This slashes emissions that negatively impact both air quality and climate.</p><p>And yet again… a hangup: what exactly is this electric doohickey? Is it a truck? A trailer? Something else? It was clear from the regulations that it was a “converter dolly”. But getting complete alignment on that simple fact across an alphabet soup of government agencies spanning both federal and state—NHTSA, FMCSA, FHWA, state transit authorities, air quality management districts, state DMVs, highway patrols and more—took years.</p><p>A “powered converter dolly” isn’t even a new thing! Here’s one from the sixties that ran on diesel to help trucks get over mountain passes:</p><p>There were some bright spots. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) quickly converged on informal definitional clarity, and then eventually a Highway Patrol Captain who was eager to get innovative electric vehicles on the road pushed it through with a state DMV to register the first four Revoys. But bringing along the rest of the agencies, and the rest of the states, was not fast. It delayed deployments, soaked up hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal and lobbyist time (not to mention all the corresponding time on the government side that all of us taxpayers have to bear), and maybe most importantly… even with a formal memo from the Federal DOT, it is still not 100% resolved in some states.</p><p>As one example, one state agency has asked Revoy to do certified engine testing to prove that the Revoy doesn’t increase emissions of semi trucks. And that Revoy must do this certification across every single truck engine family. It costs $100,000 per certification and there are more than 270 engine families for the 9 engines that our initial partners use. That’s $27,000,000 for this one regulatory item. And keep in mind that this is to certify that a device—whose sole reason for existence is to cut pollution by &gt;90%, and which has demonstrably done so across nearly 100,000 miles of testing and operations—is not increasing the emissions of the truck. It’s a complete waste of money for everyone.</p><p>And that $27M dollar cost doesn’t include the cost to society. This over-regulation will delay deployment of EV trucks by years, increasing NOₓ and PM 2.5 air pollution exposure for many of society’s least well-off who live near freeways. The delayed deployment will also increase CO₂ emissions that threaten the climate and environment. Revoy’s Founder (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-rust-85a41b43/\">Ian Rust</a>) and I actually disagree on what exactly it is about the regulatory environment that needs to change, but we agree it’s completely broken and hurting both people and the planet.</p><p>In every interaction I have with regulators, I’m reminded that they’re good people doing god’s work operating in a fundamentally broken system. A regulatory system that structurally insists on legalistic, ultra-extreme caution is bound to generate a massive negative return for society.</p><p>If we had a regulatory system that could move fast to experiment with creative new technologies, we’d live in a world where our environment gets cleaned up faster, where awesome new hardware was constantly improving our lives by making things better and cheaper, and where large-scale hardtech innovation happened here at home in the USA, not in China.</p><p>As we collectively work to build more manufacturing capacity at home and build the next wave of technologies to power the economy, we need to grapple with the real bottlenecks holding us back. I hope other hardtech founders will publicly share more of their stories as well (the stories I’ve heard in private would shock you). <a href=\"https://x.com/reinpk/status/1966282993707921672\">Props to Blake Scholl for doing so</a>.</p><p>We need a come-to-jesus about regulatory limits, timelines, and scope. Yes, we need basic and strong protections for clear harms, but we need to unleash every hardworking American, not just a few companies with massive funding, to invent and build hardware again. We need to combine many approaches to get there: expedited reviews for new technology, freedom to operate by default, permits by right-not-process, deleting as many regulatory steps as possible, and more. <a href=\"https://cayimby.org/\">CA YIMBY</a>’s successful push to pass a deluge of housing acceleration laws in the past two years could serve as a model.

Some days it feels like most benchmark claims look something like this:</p><p>That said, benchmarking is necessary to build good quality products that use machine learning. Machine learning development differs from traditional software development: there is a smooth gradient of failure along the “quality” axis. The way to solve this is to continuously measure the quality!</p><p>We’ve always taken benchmarking seriously at Kagi; we’ve <a href=\"https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/llm-benchmark.html\">maintained unpolluted private LLM benchmarks</a> for a long time. This lets us independently measure new models separately from their claimed performance on public benchmarks, right as they come out.</p><p>We also believe that <strong>benchmarks must be living targets</strong>. As the landscape of the internet and model capability changes, the way we measure them needs to adapt over time.</p><p>With that said, it’s good to sometimes compare ourselves on big public benchmarks. We run experiments on factual retrieval datasets like SimpleQA because they let us compare against others. Benchmarks like SimpleQA also easily measure how Kagi Search performs as a search backend against other search engines at returning factual answers.</p><h2>Kagi Tops SimpleQA, then gives up</h2><p>When we measured it in August 2025, Kagi Research achieved a <strong>95.5% score on the SimpleQA benchmark</strong>. As far as we could tell it was the #1 SimpleQA score at the time we ran it.</p><p>We’re not aiming to further improve our SimpleQA score. Aiming to score high on SimpleQA will make us “overfit” to the particularities of the SimpleQA dataset, which would make the Kagi Assistant worse overall for our users.</p><p>Since we ran it, it seems that DeepSeek v3 Terminus has since beaten the score:</p><p>SimpleQA wasn’t built with the intention of measuring search engine quality. It was <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04368\">built to test whether models “know what they know”</a> or blindly hallucinate answers to questions like <em>“What is the name of the former Prime Minister of Iceland who worked as a cabin crew member until 1971?”</em></p><p>The SimpleQA results since its release seem to tell an interesting story: LLMs do not seem to be improving much at recalling simple facts without hallucinating. OpenAI’s GPT-5 (August 2025) <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-5-system-card.pdf\">scored 55% on SimpleQA</a> (without search), whereas the comparatively weak O1 (September 2024) scored 47%.</p><p>However, “grounding” an LLM on factual data at the time of the query – a much smaller model like gemini 2.0 flash <a href=\"https://liner.com/learn/liner-accurate-ai-search\">will score 83%</a> if it can use Google Search. We find the same result – it’s common for single models to score highly if they have access to web search. We find model scoring in the area of 85% (GPT 4o-mini + kagi search) to 91% (Claude-4-sonnet-thinking +  kagi search).</p><p>Lastly, we found that <strong>Kagi’s search engine seems to perform better at SimpleQA simply because our results are less noisy</strong>. We found many, many examples of benchmark tasks where the same model using Kagi Search as a backend outperformed other search engines, simply because Kagi Search either returned the relevant Wikipedia page higher, or because the other results were <strong>not polluting the model’s context window with more irrelevant data.</strong></p><p>This benchmark unwittingly showed us that Kagi Search is a better backend for LLM-based search than Google/Bing because we filter out the noise that confuses other models.</p><h2>Why we’re not aiming for high scores on public benchmarks</h2><p>There’s a large difference between a 91% score and a 95.4% score: the second is making half as many errors.</p><p>With that said, we analyzed the remaining SimpleQA tasks and found patterns we were uninterested in pursuing.</p><p>Some tasks have <strong>contemporaneous results from official sources that disagree with the benchmark answer.</strong> Some examples:</p><p>Some other examples would <strong>require bending ethical design principles to perform well on.</strong> Let’s take one example: the question <em>“What day, month, and year was the municipality of San Juan de Urabá, Antioquia, Colombia, founded?”</em> Has a stated answer of </p><p>Lastly, it’s important to remember that SimpleQA was made by specific researchers for one purpose. It is inherently infused with their personal biases, even if the initial researchers wrote it with the greatest care.</p><p>By trying to achieve a 100% score on this benchmark, we guarantee that our model would effectively shape itself to those biases.

Under the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.</p><p>The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.</p><p>This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America’s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.</p><p>The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.</p><p>The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers’ behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency’s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.</p><p>And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency’s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.</p><p>Border Patrol’s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are “governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.”</p><p>“For national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,” the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed “to operate anywhere in the United States,” the agency added. </p><p>While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol’s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that “large-scale surveillance technology that’s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time” might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.</p><p>Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America’s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from  to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.</p><p>“They are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know … engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,” Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP’s findings. “These surveillance systems do not make communities safer.”</p><h2>‘We did everything right and had nothing to hide’</h2><p>In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina’s low country.</p><p>Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck’s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.</p><p>But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.</p><p>Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.</p><div data-align-fullwidth=\"\"><div><div><div data-module-tracksubscribe=\"\" data-gtm-topic=\"No Value\"><p>\n        Image recognition analysis overlaid on drivers and vehicles on Texas roads. (AP video Marshall Ritzel)\n    </p></div></div></div></div><p>They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash — money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.</p><p>Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paquetería El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.</p><p>“We did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,” said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver’s name and get the trailer out of impound.</p><p>Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: “whisper,” “intel” or “wall” stops. Those stops are meant to conceal — or wall off — that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who’s traveling on America’s roads and predicting who is “suspicious,” according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.</p><p>In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff’s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.</p><p>Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.</p><p>At Border Patrol’s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.</p><p>“The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” said Joel Babb, the sheriff’s deputy who stopped Schott’s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.</p><p>According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott’s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott’s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.</p><p>Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff’s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.</p><p>The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles’ travel patterns — based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.</p><p>In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone’s driver’s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. “Need BP?,” responded a group member whose number was labeled “bp Intel.” “Yes sir,” the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.</p><p>Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens’ social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.</p><p>In Schott’s case, Babb testified that federal agents “actually watch travel patterns on the highway” through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: “I just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.”</p><p>After finding nothing in Schott’s car, Babb said “nine times out of 10, this is what happens,” a phrase Schott’s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff’s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.</p><p>The Bexar County sheriff’s office declined to comment due to pending litigation and referred all questions about the Schott case to the county’s district attorney. The district attorney did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The case is pending in federal court in Texas. Schott said in an interview with the AP: “I didn’t know it was illegal to drive in Texas.”</p><h2>‘Patterns of life’ and license plates</h2><p>Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation’s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.</p><p>Border Patrol’s parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a  policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers ”for a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,” the document states.</p><p>But that’s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major — and in some places permanent — fixture of the border region.</p><p>In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, “collects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist … in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.” Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.</p><p>Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls “patterns of life” of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining “abnormal” routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle’s plates as well as its driver’s face, the official said.</p><p>Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field — develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.</p><p>The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are “read” by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system’s algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system’s algorithm can flag an unusual “pattern of life” for human inspection.</p><p>The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to “Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta” before ending up south of San Antonio.</p><p>Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.</p><p>Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company “for now” had  with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol’s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.</p><p>Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP’s public records requests.</p><p>CBP’s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program’s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas “would permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.” Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.</p><p>One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp’s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.</p><h2>Transformation of CBP into intelligence agency</h2><p>The Border Patrol’s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.</p><p>CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops. </p><p>Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.</p><p>A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.</p><p>In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol’s to prioritize border security.</p><p>“If we’re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, ‘Don’t come here,’” he said.</p><p>In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a “covert, mobile, License Plate Reader” to pipe data to Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff’s department did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency’s surveillance network.</p><p>How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol’s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.</p><p>In Trump’s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. , for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration’s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.</p><p>The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.</p><p>“We took Alek’s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,” said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. ”What we found was something much larger — a system of mass surveillance that threatens people’s freedom of movement.”</p><p>AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite “suspicious” travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.</p><p>In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase “subsequent to prior knowledge” when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.</p><p>Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.</p><p>Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don’t realize they’ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.</p><p>“I assume for every one person like me, who’s actually standing up, there’s a thousand people who just don’t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don’t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,” Schott said. “I think there’s thousands of people getting treated this way.”</p><div data-align-center=\"\"><p>Tau reported from Washington, Laredo, San Antonio, Kingsville and Victoria, Texas.

For more details, see the <a href=\"https://duckdb.org/2025/11/12/announcing-duckdb-142.html#vulnerabilities\">latest release blog post</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Databases store arbitrary information, it is clear that many if not most datasets of any value should perhaps not be plainly available to everyone. Even if stored on tightly controlled hardware like a cloud virtual machine, there have been <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">many cases</a> of files being lost through various privilege escalations. Unsurprisingly, compliance frameworks like the common <a href=\"https://secureframe.com/hub/soc-2/what-is-soc-2\">SOC 2</a> “highly recommend” encrypting data when stored on storage mediums like hard drives.</p><p>However, database systems and encryption have a somewhat problematic track record. Even PostgreSQL, the self-proclaimed “The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database” has very <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/encryption-options.html\">limited options</a> for data encryption. SQLite, the world’s “<a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html\">Most Widely Deployed and Used Database Engine</a>” does not support data encryption out-of-the-box, its encryption extension is <a href=\"https://sqlite.org/com/see.html\">a $2000 add-on</a>.</p><p>Starting with DuckDB 1.4.0, DuckDB supports <strong>transparent data encryption</strong> of data-at-rest using industry-standard AES encryption.</p><p>There are many different ways to encrypt data, some more secure than others. In database systems and elsewhere, the standard is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard\">Advanced Encryption Standard</a> (AES), which is a block cipher algorithm standardized by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology\">US NIST</a>. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning that the  key is used for both encryption and decryption of data.</p><p>For this reason, most systems choose to only support  encryption, meaning that identical plaintexts will always yield different ciphertexts (if used correctly!). The most commonly used industry standard and recommended encryption algorithm is AES – <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode\">Galois Counter Mode</a> (AES-GCM). This is because on top of its ability to randomize encryption, it also  data by calculating a tag to ensure data has not been tampered with.</p><p>DuckDB v1.4 supports encryption at rest using AES-GCM-256 and AES-CTR-256 (counter mode) ciphers. AES-CTR is a simpler and faster version of AES-GCM, but less secure, since it does not provide authentication by calculating a tag. The 256 refers to the size of the key in bits, meaning that DuckDB now only supports GCM with 32-byte keys.</p><p>GCM and CTR both require as input a (1) plaintext, (2) an initialization vector (IV) and (3) an encryption key. Plaintext is the text that a user wants to encrypt. An IV is a unique bytestream of usually 16 bytes, that ensures that identical plaintexts get encrypted into different ciphertexts. A  (nonce) is a bytestream of usually 12 bytes, that together with a 4-byte counter construct the IV. Note that the IV needs to be unique for every encrypted block, but it does not necessarily have to be random. Reuse of the same IV is problematic, since an attacker could XOR the two ciphertexts and extract both messages. The tag in AES-GCM is calculated after all blocks are encrypted, pretty much like a checksum, but it adds an integrity check that securely authenticates the entire ciphertext.</p><p>Before diving deeper into how we actually implemented encryption in DuckDB, we’ll explain some things about the DuckDB file format.</p><p>DuckDB has one  which stores data that enables it to correctly load and verify a DuckDB database. At the start of each DuckDB main database header, the magic bytes (“DUCKDB”) are stored and read upon initialization to verify whether the file is a valid DuckDB database file. The magic bytes are followed by four 8-byte of flags that can be set for different purposes.</p><p>When a database is encrypted in DuckDB, the main database header remains plaintext at all times, since the main header contains  about the contents of the database file.\nUpon initializing an encrypted database, DuckDB sets the first bit in the first flag to indicate that the database is encrypted. After setting this bit, additional metadata is stored that is necessary for encryption. This metadata entails the (1) , (2) 8 bytes of additional metadata for e.g. the encryption cipher used, and (3) the encrypted canary.</p><p>The  is used as a “salt”, and consists of 16 randomly generated bytes created upon initialization of each database. The salt is often used to ensure uniqueness, i.e., it makes sure that identical input keys or passwords are transformed into  derived keys. The 8-bytes of metadata comprise the key derivation function (first byte), usage of additional authenticated data (second byte), the encryption cipher (third byte), and the key length (fifth byte). After the metadata, the main header uses the encrypted canary to check if the input key is correct.</p><p>To encrypt data in DuckDB, you can use practically  plaintext or base64 encoded string, but we recommend using a secure 32-byte base64 key. The user itself is responsible for the key management and thus for using a secure key. Instead of directly using the plain key provided by the user, DuckDB always derives a more secure key by means of a key derivation function (kdf). The kdf is a function that reduces or extends the input key to a 32-byte secure key. If the correctness of the input key is checked by deriving the secure key and decrypting the canary, the derived key is managed in a  encryption key cache. This cache manages encryption keys for the current DuckDB context and ensures that the derived encryption keys are never swapped to disk by locking its memory. To strengthen security even more, the original input keys are immediately wiped from memory when the input keys are transformed into secure derived keys.</p><p>After the main database header, DuckDB stores two 4KB database headers that contain more information about e.g. the block (header) size and the storage version used. After keeping the main database header plaintext,  remaining headers and blocks are encrypted when encryption is used.</p><p>Blocks in DuckDB are by default 256KB, but their size is configurable. At the start of each  block there is an 8-byte block header, which stores an 8-byte checksum. The checksum is a simple calculation that is often used in database systems to check for any corrupted data.</p><p>For encrypted blocks however, its block header consists of 40 bytes instead of 8 bytes for the checksum. The block header for encrypted blocks contains a 16-byte  and, optionally, a 16-byte , depending on which encryption cipher is used. The nonce and tag are stored in plaintext, but the checksum is encrypted for better security. Note that the block header always needs to be 8-bytes aligned to calculate the checksum.</p><p>The write ahead log (WAL) in database systems is a crash recovery mechanism to ensure . It is an append-only file that is used in scenarios where the database crashed or is abruptly closed, and when not all changes are written yet to the main database file. The WAL makes sure these changes can be replayed up to the last checkpoint; which is a consistent snapshot of the database at a certain point in time. This means, when a checkpoint is enforced, which happens in DuckDB by either (1) closing the database or (2) reaching a certain threshold for storage, the WAL gets written into the main database file.</p><p>In DuckDB, you can force the creation of a WAL by setting</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>This way you’ll disable a checkpointing on closing the database, meaning that the WAL does not get merged into the main database file. In addition, by setting wal_autocheckpoint to a high threshold, this will avoid intermediate checkpoints to happen and the WAL will persist. For example, we can create a persistent WAL file by first setting the above PRAGMAs, then attach an encrypted database, and then create a table where we insert 3 values.</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>If we now close the DuckDB process, we can see that there is a  file shown: . But how is the WAL created internally?</p><p>Before writing new entries (inserts, updates, deletes) to the database, these entries are essentially logged and appended to the WAL. Only  logged entries are flushed to disk, a transaction is considered as committed. A plaintext WAL entry has the following structure:</p><p>Since the WAL is append-only, we encrypt a WAL entry . For AES-GCM this means that we append a nonce and a tag to each entry. The structure in which we do this is depicted in below. When we serialize an encrypted entry to the encrypted WAL, we first store the length in plaintext, because we need to know how many bytes we should decrypt. The length is followed by a nonce, which on its turn is followed by the encrypted checksum and the encrypted entry itself. After the entry, a 16-byte tag is stored for verification.</p><p>Encrypting the WAL is triggered by default when an encryption key is given for any (un)encrypted database.</p><p>Temporary files are used to store intermediate data that is often necessary for large, out-of-core operations such as <a href=\"https://duckdb.org/2025/09/24/sorting-again.html\">sorting</a>, large joins and <a href=\"https://duckdb.org/2021/10/13/windowing\">window functions</a>. This data could contain sensitive information and can, in case of a crash, remain on disk. To protect this leftover data, DuckDB automatically encrypts temporary files too.</p><p>There are three different types of temporary files in DuckDB: (1) temporary files that have the same layout as a regular 256KB block, (2) compressed temporary files and (3) temporary files that exceed the standard 256KB block size. The former two are suffixed with .tmp, while the latter is distinguished by a suffix with .block. To keep track of the size of .block temporary files, they are always prefixed with its length. As opposed to regular database blocks, temporary files do not contain a checksum to check for data corruption, since the calculation of a checksum is somewhat expensive.</p><p>Temporary files are encrypted (1)  when you attach an encrypted database or (2) when you use the setting <code>SET temp_file_encryption = true</code>. In the latter case, the main database file is plaintext, but the temporary files will be encrypted. For the encryption of temporary files DuckDB internally generates  This means that when the database crashes, the temporary keys are also lost. Temporary files cannot be decrypted in this case and are then essentially garbage.</p><p>To force DuckDB to produce temporary files, you can use a simple trick by just setting the memory limit low. This will create temporary files once the memory limit is exceeded. For example, we can create a new encrypted database, load this database with TPC-H data (SF 1), and then set the memory limit to 1 GB. If we then perform a large join, we force DuckDB to spill intermediate data to disk. For example:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>This sequence of commands will result in encrypted temporary files being written to disk. Once the query completes or when the DuckDB shell is exited, the temporary files are automatically cleaned up. In case of a crash however, it may happen that temporary files will be left on disk and need to be cleaned up manually.</p><p>In DuckDB, you can (1) encrypt an existing database, (2) initialize a new, empty encrypted database or (3) reencrypt a database. For example, let's create a new database, load this database with TPC-H data of scale factor 1 and then encrypt this database.</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>There is not a trivial way to prove that a database is encrypted, but correctly encrypted data should look like random noise and has a high entropy. So, to check whether a database is actually encrypted, we can use tools to calculate the entropy or visualize the binary, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/lsauer/entropy\">ent</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/sharkdp/binocle\">binocle</a>.</p><p>When we use ent after executing the above chunk of SQL, i.e., , this will result in an entropy of 7.99999 bits per byte. If we do the same for the plaintext (unencrypted) database, this results in 7.65876 bits per byte. Note that the plaintext database also has a high entropy, but this is due to compression.</p><p>Let’s now visualize both the plaintext and encrypted data with binocle. For the visualization we created both a plaintext DuckDB database with scale factor of 0.001 of TPC-H data and an encrypted one:</p><p>In these figures, we can clearly observe that the encrypted database file seems completely random, while the plaintext database file shows some clear structure in its binary data.</p><p>To decrypt an encrypted database, we can use the following SQL:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>And to reencrypt an existing database, we can just simply copy the old encrypted database to a new one, like:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>The default encryption algorithm is AES GCM. This is recommended since it also authenticates data by calculating a tag. Depending on the use case, you can also use AES CTR. This is faster than AES GCM since it skips calculating a tag after encrypting all data. You can specify the CTR cipher as follows:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>To keep track of which databases are encrypted, you can query this by running:</p><p>This will show which databases are encrypted, and which cipher is used:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p><em>5 rows —  10 columns (5 shown)</em></p><p>Here at DuckDB, we strive to achieve a good out-of-the-box experience with zero external dependencies and a small footprint. Encryption and decryption, however, are usually performed by pretty heavy external libraries such as OpenSSL. We would much prefer not to rely on external libraries or statically linking huge codebases just so that people can use encryption in DuckDB without additional steps. This is why we actually implemented encryption  in DuckDB, once with the (excellent) <a href=\"https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls\">Mbed TLS</a> library and once with the ubiquitous OpenSSL library.</p><p>DuckDB already shipped parts of Mbed TLS because we use it to verify RSA extension signatures. However, for maximum compatibility we actually disabled the hardware acceleration of MbedTLS, which has a performance impact. Furthermore, Mbed TLS is not particularly hardened against things like nasty timing attacks. OpenSSL on the other hand contains heavily vetted and hardware-accelerated code to perform AES operations, which is why we can also use it for encryption.</p><p>In DuckDB Land, OpenSSL is part of the  extension. Once you load that extension, encryption will  switch to using OpenSSL. After we shipped encryption in DuckDB 1.4.0, security experts actually found <a href=\"https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/security/advisories/GHSA-vmp8-hg63-v2hp\">issues with the random number generator</a> we used in Mbed TLS mode. Even though it would be difficult to actually exploit this, we  to databases in MbedTLS mode from DuckDB 1.4.1. Instead, DuckDB now (version 1.4.2+) tries to auto-install and auto-load the  extension whenever a write is attempted. We might be able to revisit this in the future, but for now this seems the safest path forward that still allows high compatibility for reading. In OpenSSL mode, we always used a cryptographically-safe random number generation so that mode is unaffected.</p><p>Encrypting and decrypting database files is an additional step in writing tables to disk, so we would naturally assume that there is some performance impact. Let’s investigate the performance impact of DuckDB’s new encryption feature with a very basic experiment.</p><p>We first create two DuckDB database files, one encrypted and one unencrypted. We use the TPC-H benchmark generator again to create the table data, particularly the (somewhat tired)  table.</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Now we use DuckDB’s neat  command three times: once on the unencrypted database, and once on the encrypted database using MbedTLS and once on the encrypted database using OpenSSL. We set a very low memory limit to force more reading and writing from disk.</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Here are the results on a fairly recent MacBook:  on the unencrypted table took ca. 5.4 seconds. Using Mbed TLS, this went up to around 6.2 s. However, when enabling OpenSSL the end-to-end time went straight back to 5.4 s. How is this possible? Is decryption not expensive? Well, there is a lot more happening in query processing than reading blocks from storage. So the impact of decryption is not all that huge, even when using a slow implementation. Secondly, when using hardware acceleration in OpenSSL, the overall overhead of encryption and decryption becomes almost negligible.</p><p>But just running summarization is overly simplistic. Real™ database workloads include modifications to data, insertion of new rows, updates of rows, deletion of rows etc. Also, multiple clients will be updating and querying at the same time. So we re-surrected the full TPC-H “Power” test from our previous blog post “<a href=\"https://duckdb.org/2024/09/25/changing-data-with-confidence-and-acid\">Changing Data with Confidence and ACID</a>”. We slightly tweaked the <a href=\"https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-tpch-power-test/blob/main/benchmark.py\">benchmark script</a> to enable the new database encryption. For this experiment, we used the OpenSSL encryption implementation due to the issues outlined above. We observe “Power@Size” and “Throughput@Size”. The former is raw sequential query performance, while the latter measures multiple parallel query streams in the presence of updates.</p><p>When running on the same MacBook with DuckDB 1.4.1 and a “scale factor” of 100, we get a Power@Size metric of 624,296 and a Throughput@Size metric of 450,409  encryption.</p><p>When we enable encryption, the results are almost unchanged, confirming the observation of the small microbenchmark above. However, the relationship between available memory and the benchmark size means that we’re not stressing temporary file encryption. So we re-ran everything with an 8GB memory limit. We confirmed constant reading and writing to and from disk in this configuration by observing operating system statistics. For the unencrypted case, the Power@Size metric predictably went down to 591,841 and Throughput@Size went down to 153,690. And finally, we could observe a slight performance decrease with Power@Size of 571,985 and Throughput@Size of 145,353. However, that difference is not very great either and likely not relevant in real operational scenarios.</p><p>With the new encrypted database feature, we can now safely pass around DuckDB database files with all information inside them completely opaque to prying eyes. This allows for some interesting new deployment models for DuckDB, for example, we could now put an encrypted DuckDB database file on a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A fleet of DuckDB instances could attach to this file read-only using the decryption key. This elegantly allows efficient distribution of private background data in a similar way like encrypted Parquet files, but of course with many more features like multi-table storage. When using DuckDB with encrypted storage, we can also simplify threat modeling when – for example – using DuckDB on cloud providers. While in the past access to DuckDB storage would have been enough to leak data, we can now relax paranoia regarding storage a little,  especially since temporary files and WAL are also encrypted. And the best part of all of this, there is almost no performance overhead to using encryption in DuckDB, especially with the OpenSSL implementation.</p><p>We are very much looking forward to what you are going to do with this feature, and please <a href=\"https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/new\">let us know</a> if you run into any issues.</p>","contentLength":18816,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45996585"},{"title":"NTSB Preliminary Report – UPS Boeing MD-11F Crash [pdf]","url":"https://www.ntsb.gov/Documents/Prelimiary%20Report%20DCA26MA024.pdf","date":1763662859,"author":"gregsadetsky","guid":6083,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>​​The page you're looking for doesn't exist.</h2>","contentLength":48,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45995834"},{"title":"The Lions Operating System","url":"https://lionsos.org/","date":1763662771,"author":"plunderer","guid":6109,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote>LionsOS is currently undergoing active research and\ndevelopment, it does not have a concrete verification story yet.\nIt is not expected for LionsOS to be stable at this time, but it\nis available for others to experiment with.</blockquote><p>LionsOS is an operating system based on the <a href=\"https://sel4.systems\">seL4 microkernel</a>\nwith the goal of making the achievements of seL4 accessible.

As hotelkeeper Simeon Ford colorfully put it in 1903, “We have fine hotels for fine people, good hotels for good people, plain hotels for plain people, and some bum hotels for bums.” SROs, the “bum hotels,” were the backbone of affordable housing, serving “a great army” of low-paid but skilled workers. Clustered in lively downtown districts with restaurants and services that acted as extensions of the home, SROs offered liberation from family supervision and the constraints of Victorian mores. Rooming house districts let young people mix freely and even allowed same-sex couples to live discreetly—signs of a more secular, modern urban culture. Downtown hotel life, Groth notes, “had the promise to be not just urban but urbane.”</p><p>And therein lay the problem: the urbanity of SROs collided head-on with the moralism of the Progressive Era.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-suburban-lifestyle-dream\" rel=\"\">anti-urban bias</a></p><p>By the turn of the century, they set their sights on changing the law.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/all-zoning-is-exclusionary\" rel=\"\">exclusionary zoning</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-slumless-city\" rel=\"\">urban renewal</a></p><p>In effect, SROs became a “deliberate casualty” of the new city.</p><p>Economic and policy shifts hastened their decline. Industrial jobs moved to peripheral locations only accessible by car, urban highway expansion targeted lodging-house neighborhoods, and cities encouraged office development on increasingly valuable downtown land. The “moral blight” of hotel districts had increasingly become economic blight, necessitating renewal. And because SROs didn’t count as “permanent housing” in official statistics, clearance programs could claim to displace no one. San Francisco’s urban renewal experience was typical: redevelopment in and around the Yerba Buena/Moscone Center area ultimately eliminated an estimated 40,000 hotel rooms. The public housing that replaced hotel districts—if it was built at all—often failed to accommodate single adults. To bureaucrats, the bulldozer was salubrious, “eliminating dead tissue” and “clearing away the mistakes of the past.” To the people who lived there, it wiped out their last foothold in the housing market.</p><p>By the mid-twentieth century, “millions” of SRO hotel rooms disappeared through closures, conversions, and demolition across major cities, and the modest hotel market that remained was shrinking fast. With almost no new SROs built since the 1930s, the remaining stock was vanishing by the thousands in the 1970s. New York City had 200,000 SROs when it banned new hotel construction in 1955; only 30,000 remained by 2014. As tenants changed and land values climbed, owners who once fought to save their lodging houses now wanted out; it was officials who suddenly wanted to preserve them. Tenant movements and new government programs emerged in the 1970s and ’80s, but Reagan-era cuts gutted funding, and many remaining hotels decayed into the “street hotels” opponents had long imagined: unsanitary, unsafe, and unfit for all but the city’s most desperate residents.</p><p>At the same time, demand for SRO housing was rising sharply. In the 1970s, states emptied mental hospitals without funding alternatives, pushing thousands of people with serious needs into cheap downtown hotels unequipped to support them. What was left of the SRO system became America’s accidental asylum network—the last rung of shelter for those the state had abandoned.</p><p>Thousands of people were barely hanging on, and a full-blown homelessness crisis had emerged in American cities for the first time since the Great Depression.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/were-all-experiencing-homelessness\" rel=\"\">homelessness</a><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-25-mn-27098-story.html\" rel=\"\">one advocate put it</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2025/07/how-states-and-cities-decimated-americans-lowest-cost-housing-option\" rel=\"\">writes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.gensler.com/blog/pew-study-flexible-office-to-co-living-conversions\" rel=\"\">Gensler</a></p><p>It’s a great idea—but in many cities, it’s illegal.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-case-for-single-stair-buildings\" rel=\"\">egress and corridor rules</a></p><p>None of these barriers is structural; every one is a policy choice.</p><p>We talk endlessly about the “missing middle.” But the real catastrophe was the “banished bottom”—the deliberate destruction of the cheapest rung of the housing ladder. Re-legalizing SROs won’t instantly restore a once deeply affordable housing market that provided housing at scale, but it would at least make it possible for cities to create a much cheaper form of housing that could benefit some of the 11 million extremely low-income renter households and the 800,000 homeless people in America. No city will meaningfully address the need for deeply affordable housing until it restores this missing rung—and accepts that not everyone needs a full apartment to have a full life.

Their creator — cartoonist Bill Watterson — walked away from  at the height of its popularity. </p><p>Watterson — who has given few interviews — seamlessly combined the silly, the fantastic and the profound in his strip. That slightly demented quality captured editor Lee Salem, who spoke with NPR's Renee Montagne in 2005.</p><p><em>The following exchange has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p> I remember it when I first read it, and it all... it literally took my breath away. And I circulated it in the office, and the response was immediate. It was fresh, it was funny, the art was strong, and here's this archetypal little boy living a life that some of us lived or wanted to live or remembered living. ... </p><p>One of the single favorites that I have is actually on my wall in the office, and it shows Calvin in bed, obviously with a fever or something. He's got a thermometer in his mouth. You hear the words from a television. He's watching a soap opera — you know, \"If you leave your spouse and I'll leave mine and we can get married.\" And it goes on and on and on, as lurid soap operas sometimes do. And Calvin turns to the reader with a big grin on his face, and he says, \"Sometimes, I learn more when I stay home from school than when I go.\" And I just thought that was so funny. And, amazingly, when it ran, we actually got complaints from readers who said, \"Well, you know, you're advocating that children stay home and watch adult soap operas.\" And somehow, the whole sense of irony was lost in that, but I don't think it was lost on me. I love that strip.</p><p> You know, I describe him as a little boy with his tiger friend, but there's so much more to it than that. So there's one where they're sitting philosophizing, as they often do, on the grass, this time under a tree. Hobbes is looking at the sky and saying, \"Do you think there's a god?\" And they're both gazing and thinking, and then in the fourth panel, Calvin thinks about it. And then do you remember what he says?</p><p> Yeah. \"Yeah, well, someone is out to get me.\"</p><p> Calvin was preceded into existence by some pretty famous little boys: Charlie Brown, Dennis the Menace. What made him different?</p><p> You know, we saw Calvin living in a world he never made, populated by adults and teachers, and he was trying to deal with that and accomplish what he could. I think Calvin has a bit more perhaps Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in him than Charlie Brown. Hobbes I see almost as the alter ego of Calvin. He's a balancing act that allows Calvin to exist. He provides commentary on some of Calvin's crazy adventures and attitudes.</p><p> Hobbes goes from being a stuffed tiger when there's any other person in the room, to the real Hobbes we know and love. Is Hobbes real or not?</p><p> He is to me, and obviously he is to Calvin. Whether he is to the other characters or not is an open question. But I think one of the things Bill brought to the art board was this wonderful ability to take a child's imagination and fantasy life and make it real. It really is irrelevant whether Hobbes has an existence as we would define it. For Calvin, he is there. He's a buddy, he's a companion, he's a friend.</p><p>Calvin and Hobbes<em> until the comic strip ended in 1995. Creator Bill Watterson said at the time that he wanted to explore a canvas beyond the four panels of a daily newspaper, and to work at what he called \"a more thoughtful pace,\" but has produced little public work since then.</em></p>","contentLength":3868,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45991787"},{"title":"Adversarial poetry as a universal single-turn jailbreak mechanism in LLMs","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15304","date":1763640086,"author":"capgre","guid":6024,"unread":true,"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45991738"},{"title":"Interactive World History Atlas Since 3000 BC","url":"http://geacron.com/home-en/","date":1763632331,"author":"not_knuth","guid":5973,"unread":true,"content":"<div><h2>Interactive World History Atlas since 3000 BC</h2><h2>World History Maps &amp; Timelines.

This change follows the Matrix <a href=\"https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4153?ref=element.io\"></a> that was announced at the Matrix 2025 conference on October, 17 and benefits everyone by enhancing security, but may require an action from you to continue sending &amp; receiving encrypted messages on your existing devices.</p><p>This security update will give you assurance that when you receive a message from a contact, you can effortlessly assume it’s really from them.</p><p>It’s a big step towards making Element an even more safe and reliable messaging experience. We mean it when we say that we want to provide the most secure communication technology in the world.</p><p>So here’s what’s changing and why it matters to you.</p><h2><strong>Unverified devices are a potential attack vector</strong></h2><p>Imagine you’re messaging a colleague and suddenly a warning shield icon appears on your screen. Is this just a harmless unverified device and you can safely ignore the warning, or has someone’s account been compromised? At best this is a distraction and, at worst, it is someone malicious trying to impersonate one of your contacts - neither is ideal. What’s worse is that ignoring these warnings leaves unmitigated risks to proliferate throughout your network.</p><p>With Element, trust is critical - a non-negotiable. For example, we provide end-to-end encryption by default to all of our users to ensure that you and the person you're messaging - and only the person you're messaging - can read the messages. This forthcoming change aims to eliminate uncertainty and the likelihood of malicious activity by requiring all devices to be verified.</p><h2><strong>Device verification matters</strong></h2><p>Device verification acts like a hand shake between your devices, proving cryptographically to your contacts that they belong to you. Without this verification step, messages sent from your new devices must be marked as untrusted in your conversations. By making verification mandatory, users can be confident in every message sent and received via Element and are not distracted by warnings about insecure devices.</p><h2><strong>Trust by design and default</strong></h2><p>Going forward devices will be either verified or unable to participate in conversations - it’s that simple. No more warning or shield icons that can be easily ignored, these ultimately undermine the impact of important warnings/notifications (users become desensitised).&nbsp;</p><p>By verifying your devices, you’re not just protecting your own communications, you’re creating a more trusted environment for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re designing a system that prioritises the security of your communications and making verification an integral part of the process is a great example of that.</p><h2><strong>Action required by end users</strong></h2><p>If you’re already in the habit of verifying your devices and have your recovery key set up there’s nothing you need to do to prepare, you’re good to go.</p><p>For everyone else, now is the time to take action:</p><ul><li>Check if your existing devices - mobile, web or desktop - are verified.</li><li>Set up recovery if you haven’t done that already.</li></ul><p>Note: although setting up recovery is strictly not mandatory, it is highly recommended, as it simplifies the verification of new devices, and enables you to do that even when you lose all of your current devices.</p><p>For the details of how to do this on various platforms, please read more in the <a href=\"https://docs.element.io/latest/element-support/device-verification/how-to-verify-devices/?ref=element.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">user documentation</a>. </p><h2><strong>What if you don’t verify…?</strong></h2><ul><li>Unverified devices will no longer be able to send messages.</li><li>Content of the messages received from unverified devices will not be shown (you can still see that there was a message).</li></ul><p>In short, unverified devices will effectively become unusable in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) conversations. You’ll still be able to participate in conversations where E2EE has been deactivated, but in all other circumstances you will be excluded.</p><p>As stated above, trust is fundamental to secure communication. By requiring verified devices, we are raising the bar for what users can expect from your secure communication. This is a small change that makes a big difference. We have to work together with our users to ensure success. We’re doing this work to ensure every message you send and receive is as trustworthy as a face-to-face conversation.</p><p>We’re here to make the transition as smooth as possible. If you have questions or need help, our support team is ready to assist. Together, let’s make digital communication as secure as possible for everyone.</p>","contentLength":4601,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45987179"},{"title":"The patent office is about to make bad patents untouchable","url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/patent-office-about-make-bad-patents-untouchable","date":1763589628,"author":"iamnothere","guid":5872,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/10/17/2025-19580/revision-to-rules-of-practice-before-the-patent-trial-and-appeal-board\"></a></p><blockquote></blockquote><h3><b>Why This Rule Change Matters</b></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/patents/ptab/trials/inter-partes-review\"></a></p><ul><li><b>The “Podcasting Patent” (Personal Audio)</b></li></ul><p><strong>Under the new rules, this kind of public-interest challenge could easily be blocked based on procedural grounds like timing, before the PTAB even examines the patent.&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><b>SportBrain’s “upload your fitness data” patent</b></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/ipr-process-saves-80-companies-paying-sports-motion-patent\"></a></p><p><strong>Under the new rules, this patent could have survived long enough to force dozens more companies to pay up.</strong></p><p><strong>Under the new rules, a troll like this could keep its patents alive and continue carpet-bombing small businesses with lawsuits.</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-712_87ad.pdf\"></a><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/11/tell-congress-stop-these-last-minute-bills-help-patent-trolls\"></a></p><h3><b>What the USPTO Plans To Do</b></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/09/ultramercial-case-we-love-hate\"></a><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/alice/startup-runs-patent-picture-menus\"></a><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/02/stupid-patent-month-clocking-work-app\"></a></p><h3><b>Only Congress Can Rewrite IPR</b></h3><blockquote></blockquote>","contentLength":580,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45985890"},{"title":"Precise geolocation via Wi-Fi Positioning System","url":"https://www.amoses.dev/blog/wifi-location/","date":1763589527,"author":"nicosalm","guid":5945,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I’m in <a href=\"https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/comp_sci/#:~:text=COMP%C2%A0SCI%C2%A0577%20%E2%80%94%20INTRODUCTION%20TO%20ALGORITHMS\">Introduction to Algorithms (577)</a> this semester at UW, and I’ve been enjoying hearing Renault explaining how to prove program correctness, DP, network flow, and the circumstances under which Dijkstra invented his shortest-path algorithm.</p><p>However… algos is a somewhat unique class for me, given that it’s the first course I’ve taken that mandates being present during lectures by taking attendance. It accomplishes this through a platform called <a href=\"https://tophat.com/\">TopHat</a>, who many students will recognize through its use of displaying participation questions.</p><p>TopHat asks you to provide it a four-length numerical code (that’ll be provided to you by your lecturer) in order to verify that you’re actually in the location where the attendance is being taken. You type that code into the student TopHat page, and, bam, you’re marked present.</p><p>However, I suppose they caught on to the unpatchable strategy of Having Friends, who, given that they are in the same class section as you, can be sent messages begging for the code from the comfort of your bed.</p><p>So, for the paranoid lecturer, TopHat allows “<a href=\"https://support.tophat.com/article/Educator-Taking-Attendance#SecureAttendance\">secure attendance</a>”, a feature which, according to them, determines your location as “…determined by [your] device geolocation or by both geolocation and proximity (to the classroom and other students).”</p><p>The first time I heard about this system, I wondered how much leeway this “geolocation” would afford you. There exist a plethora of traditional “IP geolocation” services, which use your IP address and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)\">ASN</a> — both semi-unique identifiers sent to the webpage upon load — to try and identify your location. This provides… varied results depending on where you’re located. When in Madison and NYC, popular IP geolocation services have been able to pin me within a mile or so of my actual location. In any suburban area, the error jumps to city-level. Surely TopHat wouldn’t be relying on such an inaccurate measure of detecting location when determining attendance — students living in Chadbourne Hall taking lectures in Mosse Humanities (approx. 250ft apart) would be able to skirt the attendance requirement. That could be catastrophic!</p><p>Alas, it is not IP geolocation being used by TopHat. As aforementioned, IP geolocation is a pretty implicit flow — webpages are able to see your IP when you connect to them. However, when trying to determine your location, TopHat pops up a big scary dialogue past the <a href=\"https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/\">line of death</a>!</p><p>Clearly this is asking something else entirely — something that’s presumably so precise as to require my explicit consent.</p><p>I’ll spare you the suspense. This is the Geolocation API, a feature of all modern browsers that allows the retrieval of your location to a  more precise degree (hence the permission pop-up). As of writing this post, IP geolocation is enough to place me somewhere in the Lakeshore neighborhood of Madison (1-2 miles long), but Chrome’s Geolocation API is enough to pin me to the exact building — Morgridge Hall — I’m sitting in. That’s orders of magnitude more accurate.</p><p>When I first experienced my laptop doing this, my first thought was “How?” There’s nothing special that my laptop has access to that would somehow allow my browser to have a more specific location… right? My laptop doesn’t have a GPS receiver in it that would allow location identification in the same way that phones can (and it isn’t just piggybacking off of my phone’s GPS, since this same location API is available on Windows devices).</p><p>When you press “allow” on the popup, your browser uses an accuracy heuristic to determine which method fetches the most accurate location. While this could be GPS (if on a cellular-enabled device) or the aforementioned IP geolocation, it will most likely have the highest success with the , a strategy that uses the wireless access points around you to identify your location.</p><p>Here’s how it works. After allowing your browser permission to access your location, a website has access to the  function. When calling it, your browser kindly asks your operating system for a list of the surrounding Wi-Fi access points — more specifically, their signal strength, SSIDs, and BSSIDs.</p><p>If those last two are foreign to you, the “SSID” of a network is just the friendly name — for example,  or . The BSSID is derived from (but not necessarily the same as) the MAC address of the access point, which is unique per each device. Having a unique identifier  is immensely important, as you can imagine just how many APs are named the same thing. Take a look at the map of APs around campus named :</p><p>Okay, so, great. We now know exactly which Wi-Fi network you’re connected to. But how does this translate to your location on a map? And how do we even know where these networks are in the real world?</p><p>The notion of associating Wi-Fi networks with their physical locations has been prevalent since the early 2000s. As far as I can tell, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhook_Wireless\">Skyhook Wireless</a> were the first to do it on a commercially-available scale, using a technique known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving\">wardriving</a>. This entails getting in a vehicle and driving around while capturing the information of as many Wi-Fi networks as possible. Since the devices doing the network scanning also have a reliable knowledge of their position (through GPS), all you have to do is associate the location of <em>where you saw the network</em> with its signal strength. Some RSSI trilateration later, and you have a roughly accurate map of Wi-Fi networks you’ve seen and their corresponding physical locations.</p><p>The useful thing is that, once in possession of all of this data, you can perform the process in reverse — on a user’s device, send a list of the Wi-Fi networks you can see (and their corresponding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indicator\">RSSI</a>), and receive an approximate guess on where that places your device in the world. For a while, that’s what everyone’s devices (including Apple ones, until iOS 3.2) did, relying on either Skyhook’s or Google’s privately collected list. The latter, interestingly enough, used their Street View vehicles (the ones taking images of roads) to capture the Wi-Fi information for a while.</p><p>However, at some point, companies realized the potential benefit of sourcing this information from the users of their devices. After all, they’re already frequently checking their GPS location and phoning home to cell towers, so why not send some anonymized Wi-Fi location data along with it?</p><p>So, that’s what Apple, Google, and Microsoft devices began doing. The location services of their products, by default, started aggregating the SSIDs and BSSIDs of Wi-Fi hotspots they could see (and their locations) and logging them for others’ devices to use for more accurate location services. And… that’s more or less the same thing that modern devices use today. When Chrome tells me that a website would like to use my location, and I allow it, the list of the surrounding hotspots will be sent to Google — which, because tens of thousands of people with GPS-enabled devices have also pinged the networks, allows my computer to obtain an extremely accurate estimation on where I am. So, thank you, everybody…?</p><p>If you were feeling a little nervous about the idea of your phone aggregating and sharing the location and information of every Wi-Fi network you’ve ever interacted with in your entire life, don’t worry, you’re not alone! There have been plenty of historical incidents with abuses of the technology.</p><p>Starting with a tough one: remember how earlier (in <a href=\"https://www.amoses.dev/blog/wifi-location/#wardriving\">wardriving</a>) I mentioned that Google historically used their Street View cars to obtain network information for their location services? It turns out that they were sniffing much more than just the headers of the packets — they were aggregating the raw 802.11 Wi-Fi data frames, which includes the non-encrypted payload of HTTP packets. I assume that very little of the internet was using HTTPS in 2010, so the reported 600 gigabytes worth of data they obtained definitely contained some things that users would probably rather them not see.</p><p>A larger and more pertinent concern tends to crop up with regards to the possibility of tracing someone’s location — which is valid, given its sensitivity. This has been a worry since WPS’ inception, but one older example I found was Elie Bursztein et al.’s talk and <a href=\"https://elie.net/blog/privacy/using-the-microsoft-geolocalization-api-to-retrace-where-a-windows-laptop-has-been\">accompanying blog post</a> “Using the microsoft geolocalization api to retrace where a windows laptop has been”. At the time, there was a bug where Windows would save a persistent record of every MAC address that you connected to, making it possible to retrace someone’s steps (thus, tracking their location as it changed) using one of numerous location APIs live at the time.</p><p>These vulnerabilities are even seen in contemporary times — Erik Rye and Dave Levin of the University of Maryland wrote “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14975\">Surveilling the Masses with Wi-Fi-Based Positioning Systems</a>” in 2024, detailing a flaw in Apple’s location services that allowed them to exfiltrate the positions of nearly two billion BSSIDs by cleverly filtering the MAC address space they were searching. Their paper’s great, and it touches on some real dangers possible from the information in the hands of an adversary, such as stalking individuals by continuously locating their router BSSID, or monitoring population density during wartime by observing the movement of groups of devices (and satellite internet constellations like Starlink).</p><p>Over time, the location service providers have improved the security of the APIs they develop. This is  important given the risks we’ve discussed, especially given that nearly every device created by these companies are, by default, sending this information to their manufacturers. Nearly every company that participates in WPS allows you to opt your BSSID out — either by changing the name of your SSID or by specifying the MAC address in a form somewhere:</p><p><i>Apple’s instructional opt out page (appending ) to the SSID.</i></p><p><i>Google’s page, which offers the same advice.</i></p><p><i>Microsoft’s form, requiring a BSSID submission to opt out.</i></p><p>If I didn’t mention it yet, this technology does have a name. It’s called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_positioning_system\">Wi-Fi positioning system</a> (WPS). There’s still a vibrant community of Wi-Fi positioning enthusiasts out there — <a href=\"https://wigle.net/\">https://wigle.net/</a> is a crowd-sourced database from recreational wardrivers who have contributed nearly two billion networks over the last 25 years. You can zoom in on your town and see the Wi-Fi density near you, and you can even check if your own network has been tagged by someone else!</p><p>I’d also be remiss if I didn’t mention <a href=\"https://beacondb.net/\">https://beacondb.net/</a>, a self described “public domain wireless geolocation database”, which, while I haven’t had time to play with, sounds like a very promising open version of the trackers so commonly used nowadays. While it doesn’t have as dense of a database as any of the other providers, I actually think it’s neat to have a lack of homogeneity among the smaller providers — it shows the data is truly different!</p><p>It’s been really fun diving down this rabbit hole to learn how our devices gain access to our location. It’s one of the more niche things that I’ve taken for granted when using my devices, and it certainly didn’t occur to me that, while in lecture, the only reason I could be marked present was because thousands of other students had (without their knowledge) pinged servers all over the world.</p>","contentLength":11413,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45985867"},{"title":"Gaming on Linux has never been more approachable","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tech/823337/switching-linux-gaming-desktop-cachyos","date":1763587802,"author":"throwaway270925","guid":5871,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p>This time I’m really going to do it.

I’ve used Macs for a decade for work, and I dabbled in Ubuntu 20-something years ago, but otherwise I’ve been a Windows guy since 3.1. At first, that’s because it’s what we had at home, later because that’s where the games were, and finally out of force of habit (and because that’s where the games were). I brought a desktop to college instead of a laptop (so I could play games), and I’ve been building my own PCs for 18 years. I started my journalism career at  magazine, testing gaming PC components.</p></div><div><p>I try to stay familiar with all the major operating systems because of my job, so in addition to my work MacBook I also have a Chromebook, a ThinkPad, and a collection of older hardware I refuse to get rid of. I can work pretty well in Windows, in macOS, or in ChromeOS.</p></div><div><p>My experiences with Linux over the past decade, on the other hand, have largely been as a series of extremely optional Tasks:</p></div><div><ul></ul></div><div><p>All of those projects, except the Chromebook one, took longer than expected, and cut into my vanishingly rare discretionary time. That’s also the time I use for gaming, reading, staring into the void, and half-starting organizational projects, so you can see how precious it is to me.</p></div><div><p>The prospect of instead using that time trying to get my computer back to a baseline level of functionality — that is, as useful as it was before I tried installing Linux — is tempting, but it’s also why I haven’t done it yet.</p></div><div><p>It’s a good time to try gaming on Linux.

In collaboration with the researchers, Meta has since addressed and mitigated the issue. The study underscores the importance of continuous, independent security research on widely used communication platforms and highlights the risks associated with the centralization of instant messaging services. The preprint of the study has now been published, and the results will be presented in 2026 at the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium.</strong></p><p>WhatsApp's contact discovery mechanism can use a user's address book to find other WhatsApp users by their phone number. Using the same underlying mechanism, the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to query more than 100 million phone numbers per hour through WhatsApp's infrastructure, confirming more than 3.5 billion active accounts across 245 countries. \"Normally, a system shouldn't respond to such a high number of requests in such a short time — particularly when originating from a single source,\" explains lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna. \"This behavior exposed the underlying flaw, which allowed us to issue an effectively unlimited requests to the server and, in doing so, map user data worldwide.\"</p><p>The accessible data items used in the study are the same that are public for anyone who knows a user's phone number and consist of: phone number, public keys, timestamps, and, if set to public, about text and profile picture. From these data points, the researchers were able to extract additional information, which allowed them to infer a user's operating system, account age, as well as the number of linked companion devices. The study shows that even this limited amount of data per user can reveal important information, both on macroscopic and individual levels.</p><h2>The study also revealed a range of broader insights:</h2><ul><li>Millions of active WhatsApp accounts were identified in countries where the platform was officially banned, including China, Iran, and Myanmar.</li><li>Population-level insights into platform usage, such as the global distribution of Android (81%) versus iOS (19%) devices, regional differences in privacy behavior (e.g., use of public profile pictures or \"about\" tagline), and variations in user growth across countries.</li><li>A small number of cases showed re-use of cryptographic keys across different devices or phone numbers, pointing to potential weaknesses in non-official WhatsApp clients or fraudulent use.</li><li>Nearly half of all phone numbers that appeared in the 2021 Facebook data leak of 500 million phone numbers (caused by a scraping incident in 2018) were still active on WhatsApp. This highlights the enduring risks for leaked numbers (e.g., being targeted in scam calls) associated with such exposures.</li></ul><p>The study did not involve access to message content, and no personal data was published or shared. All retrieved data was deleted by the researchers prior to publication. Message content on WhatsApp is “end-to-end encrypted” and was not affected at any time. “This end-to-end encryption protects the content of messages, but not necessarily the associated metadata,” explains last author Aljosha Judmayer from the University of Vienna. “Our work shows that privacy risks can also arise when such metadata is collected and analysed on a large scale.”</p><p>“These findings remind us that even mature, widely trusted systems can contain design or implementation flaws that have real-world consequences,\" says lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna: \"They show that security and privacy are not one-time achievements, but must be continuously re-evaluated as technology evolves.\"</p><p>\"Building on our previous findings on delivery receipts and key management, we are contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve and where new risks arise,\" adds co-author Maximilian Günther from the University of Vienna.</p><p>“We are grateful to the University of Vienna researchers for their responsible partnership and diligence under our Bug Bounty program. This collaboration successfully identified a novel enumeration technique that surpassed our intended limits, allowing the researchers to scrape basic publicly available information. We had already been working on industry-leading anti-scraping systems, and this study was instrumental in stress-testing and confirming the immediate efficacy of these new defenses. Importantly, the researchers have securely deleted the data collected as part of the study, and we have found no evidence of malicious actors abusing this vector. As a reminder, user messages remained private and secure thanks to WhatsApp’s default end-to-end encryption, and no non-public data was accessible to the researchers”, says Nitin Gupta, Vice President of Engineering at WhatsApp.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ethical Handling and Disclosure</h2><p>The research was conducted with strict ethical guidelines and in accordance with responsible disclosure principles. The findings were promptly reported to Meta, the operator of WhatsApp, which has since implemented countermeasures (e.g., rate-limiting, stricter profile information visibility) to close the identified vulnerability. The authors argue that transparency, academic scrutiny, and independent testing are essential to maintaining trust in global communication services. They emphasize that proactive collaboration between researchers and industry can significantly improve user privacy and prevent abuse.</p><p>This publication represents the third study by researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research examining the security and privacy of prevalent instant messengers such as WhatsApp and Signal. The team investigates how design and implementation choices in end-to-end encrypted messaging services can unintentionally expose user information or weaken privacy guarantees.</p><p>Earlier this year, the researchers published \"Careless Whisper: Exploiting Silent Delivery Receipts to Monitor Users on Mobile Instant Messengers\" (distinguished with the Best Paper Award at RAID 2025), which demonstrated how silent pings and their delivery receipts could be abused to infer user activity patterns and online behavior on WhatsApp and similar messaging platforms. Later that same year, \"Prekey Pogo: Investigating Security and Privacy Issues in WhatsApp's Handshake Mechanism\" (presented at USENIX WOOT 2025) analyzed the cryptographic foundations of WhatsApp's prekey distribution mechanism, revealing implementation weaknesses of the Signal-based protocol.</p><p>\"By building on our earlier findings about delivery receipts and key management, we're contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve, and where new risks emerge.\" said Maximilian Günther (University of Vienna).</p><p>The current study, \"Hey there! You are using WhatsApp: Enumerating Three Billion Accounts for Security and Privacy\", extends this line of research to the global scope, showing how contact discovery mechanisms can unintentionally allow large-scale user enumeration at an unprecedented magnitude. It will appear in the proceedings of the NDSS Symposium 2026, one of the leading international conferences on computer and network security.</p><p> Gabriel K. Gegenhuber, Philipp É.

Investigators found that wire-label banding prevented the wire from being fully inserted into a terminal block spring-clamp gate, causing an inadequate connection.&nbsp;</p><p>​Illustration showing how placement of wire-label banding affects the way wires are seated in their terminal blocks. (Source: NTSB) \n</p><p>After the initial blackout, the Dali’s heading began swinging to starboard toward Pier 17 of the Key Bridge. Investigators found that the pilots and the bridge team attempted to change the vessel’s trajectory, but the loss of propulsion so close to the bridge rendered their actions ineffective. A substantial portion of the bridge subsequently collapsed into the river, and portions of the pier, deck and truss spans collapsed onto the vessel’s bow and forwardmost container bays. \n</p><p>A seven-person road maintenance crew and one inspector were on the bridge when the vessel struck. Six of the highway workers died. The NTSB found that the quick actions of the Dali pilots, shoreside dispatchers and the Maryland Transportation Authority to stop bridge traffic prevented greater loss of life. \n</p><p>”Our investigators routinely accomplish the impossible, and this investigation is no different,’ said NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy. “The Dali, at almost 1,000 feet, is as long as the Eiffel Tower is high, with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Finding this single wire was like hunting for a loose rivet on the Eiffel Tower. \n</p><p>“But like all of the accidents we investigate,this was preventable,” Homendy said. “Implementing NTSB recommendations in this investigation will prevent similar tragedies in the future.” \n</p><p>Contributing to the collapse of the Key Bridge and the loss of life was the lack of countermeasures to reduce the bridge’s vulnerability to collapse due to impact by ocean-going vessels, which have only grown larger since the Key Bridge’s opening in 1977. When the Japan-flagged containership Blue Nagoya contacted the Key Bridge after losing propulsion in 1980, the 390-foot-long vessel caused only minor damage. The Dali, however, is 10 times the size of the Blue Nagoya.&nbsp;</p><p>​The comparative sizes of the Blue Nagoya and the Dali relative to the Key Bridge. (Source: NTSB) \n</p><p>As part of the investigation, the NTSB in March released an initial report on the vulnerability of bridges nationwide to large vessel strikes. The report found that the Maryland Transportation Authority—and many other owners of bridges spanning navigable waterways used by ocean-going vessels—were likely unaware of the potential risk that a vessel collision could pose to their structures. This was despite longstanding guidance from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials recommending that bridge owners perform these assessments. </p><p>The NTSB sent letters to 30 bridge owners identified in the report, urging them to evaluate their bridges and, if needed, develop plans to reduce risks. All recipients have since responded, and the status of each recommendation is available on the NTSB’s website. \n</p><p> As a result of the investigation, the NTSB issued new safety recommendations to the US Coast Guard; US Federal Highway Administration; the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; the Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK); the American National Standards Institute; the American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee on Safety in Construction and Demolitions Operations A10; HD Hyundai Heavy Industries; Synergy Marine Pte.

We’re Jason & Matt and we’re building Tweeks (<a href=\"https://tweeks.io\">https://tweeks.io</a>), a browser extension that lets you modify any website in your browser to add functionality, filter/highlight, re-theme, reorganize, de-clutter, etc. If you’ve used Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey, Tweeks is like a next‑generation userscript manager. Instead of digging through selectors and hand‑writing custom JS/CSS, describe what you want in natural language and Tweeks plans + generates your edits and applies them.<p>The modern web is so full of clutter and junk (banners, modals, feeds, and recommendations you didn’t ask for). Even a simple google search is guarded by multiple ads, an AI overview, a trending searches module, etc. before you even see the first real blue link.<p>Every day there's a new Lovable-like product (make it simple to build your own website/app) or a new agentic browser (AI agents click around and browse the web for you), but we built Tweeks to serve the middle ground: most of our time spent on the web is on someone else's site (not our own), and we don't want to offload everything to an agentic browser. We want to be able to shape the entire web to our own preferences as we browse.<p>I spent years working on recommendation systems and relevance at Pinterest, and understand how well-meaning recommendations and A/B tests can lead to website enshittification. No one sets out to make UX worse, but optimizing for an “average” user is not the same as optimizing for each individual user.<p>I’ve also been hacking “page fixers” as long as I can remember: remove a login wall here, collapse cookie banners there, add missing filters/highlights (first with F12/inspect element and eventually graduated to advanced GreaseMonkey userscripts). Tweeks started as a weekend prototype that turned simple requests into page edits but unexpectedly grew into something people kept asking to share. We hope you’ll like it too!<p>How it works: Open the Tweeks extension, type your request (e.g. “hide cookie banners and add a price/quality score”), and submit. Upon submission, the page structure is captured, an AI agent reviews the structure, plans changes, and returns deterministic transformations (selectors, layout tweaks, styles, and small scripts) that run locally. Your modifications persist across page loads and can be enabled/disabled, modified, and shared.<p>Here are a bunch of one‑shot examples from early users:<p><i>Youtube</i>: Remove Youtube Shorts.

It’s currently free, but each use costs tokens so we'll likely need to cap usage to prevent abuse. We're more interested in early feedback than your money, so if you manage to hit the cap, message us at contact@trynextbyte.com or <a href=\"https://discord.gg/WucN6wpJw2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.gg/WucN6wpJw2</a>, tell us how you're using it/what features you want next, and we'll happily reset it for you.<p>Btw if you do anything interesting with it, feel free to make a shareable link (go to ‘Library’ and press ‘share’ after generating) and include it in the comments below. It’s fun to see the different things people are coming up with!<p>We're rapidly shipping improvements and would love your feedback and comments.
