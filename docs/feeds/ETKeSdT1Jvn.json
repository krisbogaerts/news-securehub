A critical frontier in this evolution is the on-device AI agent, enabling sophisticated, AI-native experiences directly on mobile and embedded devices. While cloud-based AI faces challenges like constant connectivity demands, increased latency, privacy risks, and high operational costs, on-device breaks through these trade-offs.</p><p>We'll delve into the practical side of building and deploying AI agents with “DeliteAI”, an open-source on-device AI agentic framework. We'll explore how lightweight Python runtimes facilitate the seamless orchestration of end-to-end workflows directly on devices, allowing AI/ML teams to define data preprocessing, feature computation, model execution, and post-processing logic independently of frontend code. This architecture empowers agents to adapt to varying tasks and user contexts through an ecosystem of tools natively supported on Android/iOS platforms, handling all the permissions, model lifecycles, and many more.</p><p>Varun is the Founder and CEO of NimbleEdge, an AI startup pioneering privacy-first, on-device intelligence. With an academic foundation in AI and neuroscience from UC Berkeley, MPI Frankfurt, and IIT Kanpur, Varun brings deep expertise at the intersection of technology and science. Before founding NimbleEdge, Varun led open-source projects at OpenMined, focusing on privacy-aware AI, and published research in computer vision.</p><p>Neeraj Poddar is the Co-founder and CTO at NimbleEdge. Prior to NimbleEdge, he was the Co-founder of Aspen Mesh, VP of Engineering at Solo.io, and led the Istio open source community. He has worked on various aspects of AI, networking, security, and distributed systems over the span of his career. Neeraj focuses on the application of open source technologies across different industries in terms of scalability and security.

However, the complexity of implementing and monitoring a Zero Trust Architecture presents a significant challenge: how can non-security experts gain a clear and accurate understanding of their org's security compliance? \n\nThe reality is that the detailed data from security assessments, often standardized but dense formats like the Open Security Control Assessment Language (OSCAL), is largely impenetrable to those without deep technical knowledge. Misunderstanding of this compliance status can lead to misinformed decisions and a false sense of security.\n\nIn this talk, you will be introduced to a visualization tool to address this problem. By transforming complex OSCAL assessment results into intuitive, interactive, and digestible visuals, this tool bridges the gap between complex technical data and product insight.\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources: \nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-us-2025/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1122,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/xrkEnw1vu5c?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Portfolio Marketing Metrics and Insights - DevConf.US 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umnLnLcjwxo","date":1759221072,"author":"DevConf","guid":545,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Speaker(s): Hannah Choe\n\nCross-Portfolio team’s mission is to connect our products and services through portfolio-centric messaging and positioning to real customer outcomes.

These are the first steps in extending the MOC-A into Europe. Already, this private/public sector collaboration has created a community of new OpenShift and RHEL users with bare metal access. It has unblocked our work with partners on multiple Horizon EU projects. It has been made possible by recycling a super computer, installed in the liquid cooled Walton data centre, with operations provided by SETU, tech support for the ops team provided by Red Hat, and initial testing by the RH-OCTO team in Waterford. Positive interest around the project has attracted additional infrastructure in the form of storage funded by SETU, and an IBM Z LinuxONE mainframe. \n\nDo you need access to multiple multi node clusters on OpenShift AI on RHEL? \nDo you need access to OpenShift on OpenStack?\n\nJoin us in Boston for a quick demo.

With their portability, scalability, and efficiency, containers are becoming the building blocks of choice for deploying and operating decentralized applications (dApps) and distributed computing environments in the Web3 world. By virtualizing infrastructure and offering uniform runtime environments, containers allow developers to build, deploy, and manage services across geographically dispersed nodes—a basic ability for decentralized systems.\nThere is a new trend here that comes with new and difficult security implications. Traditional security models depend on central control and fixed boundaries, which are not easily applicable to decentralized settings. In Web3 environments, where control, execution, and data are distributed, trust and integrity are much harder to ensure. Containers in such contexts introduce new kinds of threats, such as vulnerabilities in base images, insecure communication between nodes, and the threat of tainted containers impacting a bigger network of services.\nThis session will explain how containers are fueling the decentralized cloud in Web3, both its potential and risk involved in its security. It will also examine ways to address the risks, including cryptographic identity, zero-trust networking, secure orchestration, and immutable infrastructure. Everyone in attendance will learn about the best ways to protect, grow, containerized solutions in a very decentralized world and how to address the evolving threat landscape coming their way before it gets the better of them.\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources: \nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-us-2025/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1889,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/kpnkxAmNWHw?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Probabilistic Analysis of WCETs on RT Systems: When Your Worst Case Isn't Worst - DevConf.US 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjVTyComBBc","date":1759221071,"author":"DevConf","guid":542,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Speaker(s): Aseef Imran\n\nReal-time computing has a strict rule: correctness means producing the right output within a non-negotiable deadline.

I'm sure you’ll hate me, but stick around, and you might see I’m not that far off.\n\nAgile isn’t just a business methodology; it mirrors how we naturally grow and learn.
