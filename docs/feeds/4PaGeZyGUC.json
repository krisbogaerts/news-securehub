Founded by William Wescott, William Robert Woodman, and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, the secret society claimed its authority came from mysterious \"Cipher Manuscripts\" and the \"Secret Chiefs,\" ascended beings who provided them with ancient knowledge. The order's curriculum, a blend of various mystical traditions like Hermetic Qabalah and alchemy, attracted many notable figures, including poet W.B. Yeats, and was unique for its inclusion of women. However, the society's internal rivalries, particularly a power struggle involving its most infamous member, Aleister Crowley, led to its eventual demise by 1939. Despite its short lifespan, the Golden Dawn's legacy continues to influence modern occultism, with key figures shaping our understanding of magic and mysticism.\n\nDo you love uncovering the past, exploring historic sites, and venturing to distant lands?

As the Hindu nationalist RSS movement marks its centenary, DW explores how it‚Äôs become one of India‚Äôs most influential and controversial organizations.\n\nIndia is at a crossroads. Gandhi‚Äôs vision of secularism, once central to the republic‚Äôs identity, is increasingly challenged by religion-based nationalism. At the heart of this shift is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ‚Äî a large network with millions of followers. The RSS presents itself as the guardian of Hindu values, while critics widely classify it as a paramilitary organization. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has deep roots in the RSS, its influence reaches to the highest levels of political power. \n \nThe documentary follows families, activists, and eyewitnesses who have been profoundly influenced by the RSS across generations, as well as those negatively impacted by its ideology. It reveals how the RSS, through discipline, rituals, and targeted youth training, is moulding a new generation for whom \"Hindutva\" ‚Äî the idea of a Hindu nation ‚Äî is becoming a lived reality. At the same time, religious minorities and interfaith couples face increasing social pressures and uncertainty.  \n\nFounded in 1925 by K. B. Hedgewar, the early ideological figures of the RSS ‚Äî most notably M. S. Golwalkar ‚Äî engaged with European nationalist thinking at a time when fascist regimes were gaining ground. While they did not adopt these ideologies wholesale, aspects of the organizational models employed by Mussolini and Hitler appear to have informed the movement‚Äôs structure and strategies. \n\nAs the RSS marks its 100th anniversary, its enduring and growing influence raises pressing questions: What remains of Gandhi‚Äôs vision for a pluralistic India? Where is the country heading?  And who does India belong to?\n\nThrough historical insight, personal narratives, and exclusive interviews, the film traces a nation at a crossroads ‚Äî between tradition and modernity, inclusion and exclusion. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #india #rss \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

To this day, Russian nationalists denounce it, insisting it is Western propaganda, historically inaccurate, and unfair to Ivan the Terrible.\nBut the painting leaves little room for doubt. Here, Ivan the Terrible - Russia‚Äôs first crowned Tsar - has just struck down his own son in a violent rage, moments after attacking his pregnant daughter-in-law and causing her to miscarry.\nThis isn‚Äôt simply a historical scene. It is a universal story of rage, regret, domination, and destruction - an image that still reverberates through time. And is still relevant. \n\nIMPORTANT!  \nSubscribe and click the bell icon to be notified! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCePD... \n\nI would like to thank all my Patreon supporters, in particular Alan Stewart, Alexander Velser, AMSN, Andrei Surei, Anja Zeutschel, Bria Nicole Art, Brian J Rich, David Asabreu, Ed Gobbi, \"Elias', Eric Mann, Francis Song, Griffin Evans, Jemma Theivendran, Joe Kool, Jon Hanzen, Julio Cardenas, Kibibi Shaw, Louise Tait, Matthew Bondaryk, Mitch Kosowski, Monte St Johns, New Curiosity, Paul Ark, Paul Waterman, Daniel Rakovski, Sam Blakelock, Sean Welgemoed, Stephen Beresford, Tanya Moore, Theresa Garfink, and Toni Ko. \n\n\n\"What a brilliant series this is\" - Stephen Fry on Twitter (X) \n\nCREDITS \nScript co-written by Laura Beardsell-Moore \nOpening \nAnimation and Title Sequence by Brian Adsit (instagram https://instagram.com/brian_vfx?utm_m... and Behance www.behance.com/badsit88) \nRecording by Robert Lewis \n\nVIDEOS \nAll the videos, songs, images, and graphics used in the video belong to their respective owners and I or this channel do not claim any right over them. \n\nMUSIC \nProkofiev Toccata D minor, op 11\nProkofiev Romeo and Juliet Dance of the Knights \n\nBOOKS \nThe Russian Vision: The Art of Ilya Repin by David Jackson \nIlya Repin (Great Painters) by G.IU.

Zarema‚Äôs family is doing everything they can to ensure she is not forgotten.\n\nEvery dictator has their own way of intimidating opponents. In Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov punishes human rights activists by imprisoning someone close to them. Abubakar, Ibragim and Baisangur Yangulbayev are vocal critics of Ramzan Kadyrov. They denounce abuses in Chechnya on the internet and were forced to flee Russia. Their mother Zarema Musayeva was less fortunate. In January 2022, authorities abducted her from her home in Nizhny Novgorod, some 1,800 kilometers from the Chechen capital Grozny. Her health has deteriorated significantly since then. She suffers from diabetes but is forced to do hard labor. Zarema is paying a high price for the commitment of her sons, who are continuing their actions in exile in the hope that international attention will save their mother's life. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #kadyrov #chechnya #humanrights \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The San Andreas Fault, a 1,300-kilometer-long fracture zone in the earth's crust, runs through the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Scientists fear a major earthquake.\n\nThe San Andreas Fault is currently the most strongly observed geological phenomenon in the world. Scientists have long feared an earthquake so strong that it could mean the death of thousands of people. Economic damage, running into the billions, would also result. \n\nConcerns are growing, as seismologists currently estimate that the next earthquake will occur before 2032. They put the probability of this at over 70%. For them, it is a race against time. \n\nThe documentary shows the scientific efforts being made to predict the unpredictable. International seismologists are studying the fault to make more accurate forecasts. The aim is also to reduce the risks for people. \n\nWith the help of 3D animations and aerial photographs, the researchers' fascinating engineering approaches come to light. For them, the question is not whether the big quake will come, but when.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #earthquake #california #usa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Matt Kirshen take on Hubble Tension, the difference between the estimated ages of the universe, and how to solve it with legendary astronomer Wendy Freedman.\n\nWe trace the debate from the early days with Henrietta Leavitt‚Äôs discovery of Cepheid variables through today‚Äôs most precise measurements. Why do local distance measurements (Cepheids, tip of the red-giant branch, carbon stars) give a different expansion rate than the cosmic microwave background? Could dust be dimming our view, or systematic errors biasing our results? Or do we require discovering new physics?\n\nWe break down the Hubble tension and what caused it. How did the Hubble telescope complicate the existing debate, between 10 and 20 billion years old, through more precise measurements? We explore possible explanations: local density fluctuations, evolving dark energy, or something missing from the standard model. Are we missing something fundamental hiding in plain sight? Could the Hubble constant vary with time, or even by location in the universe?\n\nListener questions push the frontier further: Could dark energy distort our distance calculations? How would we measure expansion if we traveled to another galaxy? Would it matter scientifically, or emotionally, if the universe is finite or infinite? Through it all, Neil reminds us that science isn‚Äôt democracy, it‚Äôs data.\n\nThanks to our Patrons Smallevent, Ralph, Arun, Pandey, Nick Ohlheiser, Dantheman, Brian Campana, Mel, Micheal TRilling, Daniel Arvizu, James, Lily Morant, Jon Githrex, Daniel Frank, Gini Kramer, Opal Lehman, M M, pheobekate, Najwa DeForest, Kyle, Mama M, Jerome Cameron, Charles, David \"Kiwi\" Keller, Scott Chaddon, Erin T, Quin Shimamura, Wilma, Jerry the Epicurean, Matt Brady, loreen spchler, AlexK89, Eric Lee, Mantautas Jokubenas, Dustin, Regina Rhew Hoilman, Professional Dave, Nicholas Hayes, Joe White, Eddie Olsson, Amanda Granberry, Gloria Askin, Crimson Blaze, Steven Banker, Chris Washington, Ethan, oliver cooke, Terrence Sauvain, Maurice van der Linden, Yesking, joe vaughn, Micheal Wilson, Daaku, Espen Sande Larsen, Deepanshu Biniwale, Alexis Barrera, Kalie Pillar, ConcernedOnlooker, Margaret, Vinay Murthy, Finesse TheGod, Fraser PArk Vlad, AdamJ, Alexander Verharen, Susan Soard, Pete, Jaidyn Janis, Joe, AndyL, and Paul Williams for supporting us this week.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction: Wendy Freedman\n08:10 - What‚Äôs Hubble Tension?\n15:32 - Cracks in Our Theories &amp; Uncertainties\n21:24 - Solving the Crisis\n29:37 - Precision v.

Some of these ghost towns are well-known, like Rhyolite, but others are just coordinates on a map ‚Äî hidden like secrets to the true history of Nevada.\n\nVox video producer Dolly Li road tripped through northern Nevada to try and find some of these hidden ghost towns and learn about the real history behind the boom and bust cycles of mining in the state. Along the way, she stops by a town that many call a ghost town, but is still partially occupied by a dozen residents.\n\nThrough visiting a few abandoned mining towns and speaking to historians about the technology and infrastructure that made mining a key industry of the state, we piece together a rich and fascinating story of Nevada‚Äôs development.\n\nWe had a chance to speak to a lot of great experts and historians for this video. Here are some links to their work:\n\nTami Force‚Äôs website, Nevada Ghost Towns &amp; Beyond, where she‚Äôs documented hundreds of ghost towns in the state:\nhttps://nvtami.com/\n\nThe archives of the W.M. Keck Earth Science and Mineral Engineering Museum (The Keck Museum), curated by Garrett J. Barmore, where we also conducted one of our interviews:\nhttps://www.unr.edu/keck-museum\n\nThe Friends of Midas, a nonprofit organization currently run by Dana Bennett, that has a great collection of photos and history about the town of Midas:\nhttps://friendsofmidas.com/\n\n#ghosttowns #nevada #travel #roadtrip\nThis video is presented by Travel Nevada.
