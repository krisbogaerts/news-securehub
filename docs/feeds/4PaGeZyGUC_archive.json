Founded by William Wescott, William Robert Woodman, and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, the secret society claimed its authority came from mysterious \"Cipher Manuscripts\" and the \"Secret Chiefs,\" ascended beings who provided them with ancient knowledge. The order's curriculum, a blend of various mystical traditions like Hermetic Qabalah and alchemy, attracted many notable figures, including poet W.B. Yeats, and was unique for its inclusion of women. However, the society's internal rivalries, particularly a power struggle involving its most infamous member, Aleister Crowley, led to its eventual demise by 1939. Despite its short lifespan, the Golden Dawn's legacy continues to influence modern occultism, with key figures shaping our understanding of magic and mysticism.\n\nDo you love uncovering the past, exploring historic sites, and venturing to distant lands?

As the Hindu nationalist RSS movement marks its centenary, DW explores how it‚Äôs become one of India‚Äôs most influential and controversial organizations.\n\nIndia is at a crossroads. Gandhi‚Äôs vision of secularism, once central to the republic‚Äôs identity, is increasingly challenged by religion-based nationalism. At the heart of this shift is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ‚Äî a large network with millions of followers. The RSS presents itself as the guardian of Hindu values, while critics widely classify it as a paramilitary organization. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has deep roots in the RSS, its influence reaches to the highest levels of political power. \n \nThe documentary follows families, activists, and eyewitnesses who have been profoundly influenced by the RSS across generations, as well as those negatively impacted by its ideology. It reveals how the RSS, through discipline, rituals, and targeted youth training, is moulding a new generation for whom \"Hindutva\" ‚Äî the idea of a Hindu nation ‚Äî is becoming a lived reality. At the same time, religious minorities and interfaith couples face increasing social pressures and uncertainty.  \n\nFounded in 1925 by K. B. Hedgewar, the early ideological figures of the RSS ‚Äî most notably M. S. Golwalkar ‚Äî engaged with European nationalist thinking at a time when fascist regimes were gaining ground. While they did not adopt these ideologies wholesale, aspects of the organizational models employed by Mussolini and Hitler appear to have informed the movement‚Äôs structure and strategies. \n\nAs the RSS marks its 100th anniversary, its enduring and growing influence raises pressing questions: What remains of Gandhi‚Äôs vision for a pluralistic India? Where is the country heading?  And who does India belong to?\n\nThrough historical insight, personal narratives, and exclusive interviews, the film traces a nation at a crossroads ‚Äî between tradition and modernity, inclusion and exclusion. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #india #rss \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

To this day, Russian nationalists denounce it, insisting it is Western propaganda, historically inaccurate, and unfair to Ivan the Terrible.\nBut the painting leaves little room for doubt. Here, Ivan the Terrible - Russia‚Äôs first crowned Tsar - has just struck down his own son in a violent rage, moments after attacking his pregnant daughter-in-law and causing her to miscarry.\nThis isn‚Äôt simply a historical scene. It is a universal story of rage, regret, domination, and destruction - an image that still reverberates through time. And is still relevant. \n\nIMPORTANT!  \nSubscribe and click the bell icon to be notified! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCePD... \n\nI would like to thank all my Patreon supporters, in particular Alan Stewart, Alexander Velser, AMSN, Andrei Surei, Anja Zeutschel, Bria Nicole Art, Brian J Rich, David Asabreu, Ed Gobbi, \"Elias', Eric Mann, Francis Song, Griffin Evans, Jemma Theivendran, Joe Kool, Jon Hanzen, Julio Cardenas, Kibibi Shaw, Louise Tait, Matthew Bondaryk, Mitch Kosowski, Monte St Johns, New Curiosity, Paul Ark, Paul Waterman, Daniel Rakovski, Sam Blakelock, Sean Welgemoed, Stephen Beresford, Tanya Moore, Theresa Garfink, and Toni Ko. \n\n\n\"What a brilliant series this is\" - Stephen Fry on Twitter (X) \n\nCREDITS \nScript co-written by Laura Beardsell-Moore \nOpening \nAnimation and Title Sequence by Brian Adsit (instagram https://instagram.com/brian_vfx?utm_m... and Behance www.behance.com/badsit88) \nRecording by Robert Lewis \n\nVIDEOS \nAll the videos, songs, images, and graphics used in the video belong to their respective owners and I or this channel do not claim any right over them. \n\nMUSIC \nProkofiev Toccata D minor, op 11\nProkofiev Romeo and Juliet Dance of the Knights \n\nBOOKS \nThe Russian Vision: The Art of Ilya Repin by David Jackson \nIlya Repin (Great Painters) by G.IU.

Zarema‚Äôs family is doing everything they can to ensure she is not forgotten.\n\nEvery dictator has their own way of intimidating opponents. In Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov punishes human rights activists by imprisoning someone close to them. Abubakar, Ibragim and Baisangur Yangulbayev are vocal critics of Ramzan Kadyrov. They denounce abuses in Chechnya on the internet and were forced to flee Russia. Their mother Zarema Musayeva was less fortunate. In January 2022, authorities abducted her from her home in Nizhny Novgorod, some 1,800 kilometers from the Chechen capital Grozny. Her health has deteriorated significantly since then. She suffers from diabetes but is forced to do hard labor. Zarema is paying a high price for the commitment of her sons, who are continuing their actions in exile in the hope that international attention will save their mother's life. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #kadyrov #chechnya #humanrights \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The San Andreas Fault, a 1,300-kilometer-long fracture zone in the earth's crust, runs through the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Scientists fear a major earthquake.\n\nThe San Andreas Fault is currently the most strongly observed geological phenomenon in the world. Scientists have long feared an earthquake so strong that it could mean the death of thousands of people. Economic damage, running into the billions, would also result. \n\nConcerns are growing, as seismologists currently estimate that the next earthquake will occur before 2032. They put the probability of this at over 70%. For them, it is a race against time. \n\nThe documentary shows the scientific efforts being made to predict the unpredictable. International seismologists are studying the fault to make more accurate forecasts. The aim is also to reduce the risks for people. \n\nWith the help of 3D animations and aerial photographs, the researchers' fascinating engineering approaches come to light. For them, the question is not whether the big quake will come, but when.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #earthquake #california #usa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Matt Kirshen take on Hubble Tension, the difference between the estimated ages of the universe, and how to solve it with legendary astronomer Wendy Freedman.\n\nWe trace the debate from the early days with Henrietta Leavitt‚Äôs discovery of Cepheid variables through today‚Äôs most precise measurements. Why do local distance measurements (Cepheids, tip of the red-giant branch, carbon stars) give a different expansion rate than the cosmic microwave background? Could dust be dimming our view, or systematic errors biasing our results? Or do we require discovering new physics?\n\nWe break down the Hubble tension and what caused it. How did the Hubble telescope complicate the existing debate, between 10 and 20 billion years old, through more precise measurements? We explore possible explanations: local density fluctuations, evolving dark energy, or something missing from the standard model. Are we missing something fundamental hiding in plain sight? Could the Hubble constant vary with time, or even by location in the universe?\n\nListener questions push the frontier further: Could dark energy distort our distance calculations? How would we measure expansion if we traveled to another galaxy? Would it matter scientifically, or emotionally, if the universe is finite or infinite? Through it all, Neil reminds us that science isn‚Äôt democracy, it‚Äôs data.\n\nThanks to our Patrons Smallevent, Ralph, Arun, Pandey, Nick Ohlheiser, Dantheman, Brian Campana, Mel, Micheal TRilling, Daniel Arvizu, James, Lily Morant, Jon Githrex, Daniel Frank, Gini Kramer, Opal Lehman, M M, pheobekate, Najwa DeForest, Kyle, Mama M, Jerome Cameron, Charles, David \"Kiwi\" Keller, Scott Chaddon, Erin T, Quin Shimamura, Wilma, Jerry the Epicurean, Matt Brady, loreen spchler, AlexK89, Eric Lee, Mantautas Jokubenas, Dustin, Regina Rhew Hoilman, Professional Dave, Nicholas Hayes, Joe White, Eddie Olsson, Amanda Granberry, Gloria Askin, Crimson Blaze, Steven Banker, Chris Washington, Ethan, oliver cooke, Terrence Sauvain, Maurice van der Linden, Yesking, joe vaughn, Micheal Wilson, Daaku, Espen Sande Larsen, Deepanshu Biniwale, Alexis Barrera, Kalie Pillar, ConcernedOnlooker, Margaret, Vinay Murthy, Finesse TheGod, Fraser PArk Vlad, AdamJ, Alexander Verharen, Susan Soard, Pete, Jaidyn Janis, Joe, AndyL, and Paul Williams for supporting us this week.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction: Wendy Freedman\n08:10 - What‚Äôs Hubble Tension?\n15:32 - Cracks in Our Theories &amp; Uncertainties\n21:24 - Solving the Crisis\n29:37 - Precision v.

The conversation explores the tension between emergent and designed architecture, the importance of sustainable versus \"slash-and-burn\" development approaches, and how architectural decisions scale with organizational growth.\nKey themes include the critical role of communication and coaching in architecture, the dangers of pattern cargo-culting, and the fundamental reality that all architectural challenges are ultimately people problems requiring empathy, shared language, and cultural change.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:33 Defining software architecture in a modern context\n04:13 Sustainable vs Slash-and-burn architecture\n07:41 The role of the modern software architect\n15:57 Language &amp; communication in software architecture\n20:46 Scale &amp; organizational growth\n25:18 Decision-making processes &amp; advice forums\n29:45 Balancing standards with team autonomy\n32:53 The pattern problem &amp; design wisdom\n44:50 The transition to leadership &amp; coaching\n50:41 Communication is key\n55:13 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBarry O'Reilly ‚Ä¢ Residues ‚Ä¢ https://leanpub.com/residuality\nBarry O'Reilly ‚Ä¢ The Architect's Paradox ‚Ä¢ https://leanpub.com/architectsparadox\nDiana Montalion ‚Ä¢ Learning Systems Thinking ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ\nSam Newman ‚Ä¢ Monolith to Microservices ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/2Nml96E\nRonnie Mitra &amp; Irakli Nadareishvili ‚Ä¢ Microservices: Up and Running‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3c4HmmL\nJacqui Read ‚Ä¢ Communication Patterns ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3E37lvv\nVaughn Vernon &amp; Tomasz Jaskula ‚Ä¢ Strategic Monoliths &amp; Microservices ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3AcUscj\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#SoftwareArchitecture #Microservices #MicroservicesArchitecture #Monolith #MonolithToMicroservices #TodayInTech #IanCooper #DavidWhitney #HannesLowette\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

The trial, orchestrated by Thomas Cromwell, was a spectacle designed to guarantee a guilty verdict, with Anne's own uncle and father on the jury. Despite a strong and dignified defense against the flimsy evidence, Anne was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death. Her conviction and impending execution were sealed by the prior conviction of the five men she was accused of having affairs with, a verdict that was almost certainly the result of torture and coercion. The trial is presented as a gross miscarriage of justice, serving King Henry VIII's desire to marry Jane Seymour and remove Anne permanently.\n\nDo you love uncovering the past, exploring historic sites, and venturing to distant lands?

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.\n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.\n\nThe film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

But for these women from Kharkiv, Ukraine, being in this team was never just about winning or exercise. It always meant much more.\n\nThen Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine - and their friendship and seemingly indestructible team cohesion were put to the test. Each team member faced a difficult choice: to stay or leave; to remain in their home country or bring their family and themselves to safety. Sveta, a member of the core team, chose to flee to the Netherlands with her family, while captain Valia and coach Nadia held out in Kharkiv, a city that has been bombed repeatedly. Despite terror, heartache, and Sveta's feelings of guilt for having left Ukraine, the women try to stay connected as their lives and views drift apart. \n\nDirector Mariia Ponomarova met the \"Nice Ladies\" cheerleading squad long before Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine began. She was impressed by their joy and team spirit. This documentary is a long-time observation of the group, capturing the highs and lows of their lives, and showing how friendships are tested in war.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ukraine \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

How many years? Can you make an attempt to play it now?\n10:59 Chopin's Allegro de concert Op. 46\n18:16 How do I stop feeling intimidated when first looking at the scores? I have recently started playing more advanced-ish repertoire and the sheet music in the beginning seems terrifying and that discourages me from learning many pieces.\n24:58 TCP &amp; TCP Merch PLUG\n26:10 What are your thoughts on the Pogorelich scandal at the 1980 Chopin competition? Do you feel like creative liberties should be taken at competitions or is a specific way of playing more encouraged?\n32:17 What happens when someone comes on and plays and it's not to your taste, but there's some part of you that recognizes that it's genius?\n36:13 As concert pianists, do you still encounter new technical struggles that can take days or weeks to resolve? Or are most challenges in artistry and interpretation?\n41:47 Technique in Beethoven Op. 31, No. 3 (II. Scherzo)\n46:06 When I play the same piece for a long time, it starts to sound too rehearsed and pre-planned. Do you have any tips to keep pieces sounding spontaneous, even after a very long time?  \n54:24 Garrick plays Prokofiev's 8th sonata\n56:30 If you could ask Chopin himself to clarify or set the record about a particular aspect to one of his pieces, what would you ask?\n1:00:40 Could you imagine doing anything other than music, and if so what would you do?\n1:05:52 How much of the supposed differences in style and interpretation from modern pianists vs past eras can be attributed to differences in recording technology vs actual playing differences?\n1:14:53 I have a question about beethoven. What do you think are the most important elements of playing beethoven because I find that it is different in the sense that may not so heart felt like chopin.\n1:23:28 For the less advanced pianist, should the focus be more on developing technique and learning new pieces, or on making each piece as artistic and polished as possible?\n1:37:03 Which round of the Chopin Competition are you generally most looking forward to?\n1:40:41 How many Chopin melodies can you play in 60 seconds ?\n1:44:18 Can Garrick play the first chord/notes of every single Beethoven sonata in 64 seconds?\n1:46:48 Do you remember a specific work of Chopin that really got you hooked into the realm of classical piano?

How did you manage to keep the energy going? \n2:27:09 Favorite mazurka? and why?\n2:31:41 When will Kate Liu do an episode?\n2:33:20 In what ways was it different studying at the Julliard school back in the day compared to now?\n2:39:14 How can we watch the competition?

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly explore current research into how large language models affect our cognition, memory, and learning with Nataliya Kosmyna, research scientist at the MIT Media Lab. Is AI good for us? \n\nNataliya describes her experiment comparing students writing essays with three methods: ChatGPT, Google, or just their own brains. What happened when groups swapped? Why did the ‚ÄúLLM group‚Äù show the least functional connectivity in the brain, while Google users lit up their visual cortex? Why did so many students fail to recall or even quote their own work? Neil and Nataliya unpack how timing, cognitive load, and brain struggle are essential for true learning.\n\nWe explore cognitive load theory, video game design, and whether doctors relying on AI could lose diagnostic skills. How much AI support is too much? Could AI free up tasks so we can use our cognitive energy elsewhere? Or does it rob us of our brain power? We discuss the efficiency of the brain versus machine learning, the risks of AI companionship amplifying loneliness (or even AI psychosis) to how education must adapt for a generation raised with AI. What happens when children grow up never learning the skills that AI replaces? Does outsourcing brain work free us to be more creative or leave us dependent?\n\nWe discuss the guardrails and the crisis across schooling. How do we adapt the education system around these tools? What do we stand to lose? What do we stand to gain? Does this mean pivoting the focus away from grades and towards a more process and learning focus?

But in practice, it is a state within a state. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the region seceded in a bloody civil war. It has its own flag, currency and government.\n\nThe self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria is not internationally recognized. But it has been closely intertwined with Russia politically, economically and militarily for decades. Some 1,500 Russian soldiers are permanently stationed in the region. In spring 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there were explosions and attacks on government buildings.\nSince the Republic of Moldova was granted EU accession candidate status in 2022, the long-forgotten region has once again become the focus of geopolitical power games. \nWhile the Moldovan capital Chi≈üinƒÉu tends to pursue a more pro-European course, many people in Transnistria cling to Russia - despite problems like Transnistria‚Äòs deep poverty. The region's economy is dominated by a powerful network of oligarchs. Critics speak of a system of mutual protection between business, politics and pro-Russian power structures.\nUntil the beginning of 2025, Transnistria's economy was reliant on gas from Russia. A fragile balancing act - as some 80 percent of Transnistria‚Äôs exports go to the EU. But the energy crisis that followed the gas freeze has exacerbated tensions in the region. \nWhile pro-Russian actors want to expand their power, supporters of a pro-European course are focusing on greater integration into the EU. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #transnistria #moldova #russia #europe \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Now the company is betting on the reinvention of its Siri voice assistant to carry it into the generative AI age, and maybe gain ground on the competition. \n\nGet the Power On newsletter for the inside scoop on all things Apple and consumer tech.\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_campaign=originals&amp;utm_content=article\n\nRead more here: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_campaign=originals&amp;utm_content=article\n\n00:00 Introduction \n01:10 Siri‚Äôs origins\n03:18 AI and ChatGPT boom\n04:59 Apple‚Äôs missteps \n06:00 Fixing Siri\n07:31 Challenges \n\n#AI #Apple #Technology \n\n--------\nLike this video?

But thanks to his tireless commitment to peace and human rights, he is also one of the most famous personalities in contemporary history.\n\nThis documentary tells the story of how the son of a simple farming family became the spiritual leader of the Tibetans. At the age of just four years old, Lhamo Dhondup became the 14th Dalai Lama. He journeyed to the capital of Tibet, Lhasa. From then on, he was constantly surrounded by an entourage. His childhood was over. \nWhen the People's Republic of China was founded, Mao Zedong announced that he also wanted to \"liberate‚Äù Tibet. In 1950, Chinese troops advanced into Lhasa and occupied the country. The film shows the Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959 -- the result of years of oppression by Chinese rulers.\nFor decades now, the Dalai Lama has led the Tibetan government in exile from Dharamsala, India. He has also traveled the world as a peace activist. He celebrated his 90th birthday in July 2025. Observers speculate that China will exert its influence in the appointment of a successor. The consequences for Tibet are unforeseeable. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #dalailama #tibet \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

At the same time, it‚Äôs also a powerful account of how faith leaders worldwide are seeking to mitigate the worst consequences of the climate crisis by drawing on indigenous knowledge, practices and beliefs.</article>","contentLength":1467,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/9s47xBbfqzo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"L.I.S.A.'s Universe Window Discoveries are Beyond Expectation","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/V8T0oaudXAI","date":1758748688,"author":"StarTalk","guid":371,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

For people in countries like India or the Philippines, however, it is already very real. Extreme heat dominates everyday life. Heavy rain washes away houses and roads.\n\nJoan Baking lives with her family in a cemetery in the Philippine capital Manila. Temperatures of more than 30 degrees already prevail there in March. The only way to cool down in the small house is a fan on the ceiling. Joan is pregnant and her body is suffering from heat stress, for which she is taking medication. As a result, her son is born with a severe form of asthma. A disease that worsens in the heat. The family cannot afford hospital treatment. \n\nIn the Indian state of Uttarakhand, people have always lived with the monsoon rains. In August 2022, however, the rainfall was so heavy that a tidal wave swept through the Doon Valley, tearing away everything near the banks. The village of Maldevta was completely buried under rubble and mud. 18-year-old Shivani lost her father. Now she and her siblings have to build a new house - further away from the river -- without the support of their father. They cannot estimate how heavy the next monsoon rains will be. But they have been living in constant fear of new floods ever since the last disaster. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #climatechange #india #philippines \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice explore LISA and the future of gravitational wave astronomy with astrophysicist Kelly Holley-Bockelmann.\n\nSave LISA: https://www.savelisa.org/\n\nHow does LISA differ from LIGO? Learn about LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, and how these spacecraft will help us detect gravitational waves from space. Why does it need three spacecraft millions of kilometers apart, linked by laser beams? And how can orbiting cubes of gold and platinum reveal the secrets of colliding black holes?\n\nKelly explains why supermassive black hole mergers are her favorite cosmic events, how LISA could detect EMRIs‚Äìtiny black holes orbiting giants‚Äìand why the mission‚Äôs three-node triangular design matters. We explore the engineering challenges, from solar storms to relativity itself, and why interferometry is one of the most precise measuring tools ever invented.\n\nThe conversation turns to funding, politics, and why U.S. withdrawal could leave China to take the lead. What technologies might spin off from LISA? Could we one day have GPS, but for the entire solar system? And could LISA finally detect primordial black holes or the faint gravitational hum of the Big Bang itself?\n\nThanks to our Patrons Bobby, Ron Abernethy, yogesh job, Jared Richardson, cgillies87, John .A, Russell Hughes, Andy Revans, Darkeiser, TRacey Rankin, Anna Elliott, Andres Ortiz, Vavilov, Jeremy Nadeau, Mr Wolfgang, NorCalPhys, Advait Aithal, Alii Torres, Cody Pflieger, David Mauricio Perez de la Pe√±a, Tommy Hadden, Kayce Rawlins, Ryan, Brian Hendershot, jenna Mich, smopeh, Boris Bendikov, Eileen, Matt Zullow, James Pickney, Micheal del Campo, Marsya, MomShikib, Syaz S., Jacob Harasymenko, Kevin Ingalls, Tom Reed, Paul S AKA Paul Biberdork, Treven Price, Tatiana, The Eye Child, STEPHEN R SMALL, Jedi_B0mbadil, Milton Fl√°vio S.

Many young people are torn between staying and leaving, resignation and activism. On September 28, they will cast their vote for which path their country will take.\n\nBordered by EU-member Romania on the west and Ukraine to the north and east, Moldova is Europe‚Äôs poorest nation. Jobs are scarce, and especially the young struggle with a lack of prospects. The documentary follows three young Moldovans who respond in very different ways to the challenges their country faces more than 30 years after independence from the Soviet Union.\nAna Popa spent years abroad but made a conscious choice to return home. Determined to make a difference, she organizes protest bike rides and marches, and campaigns to strengthen civil society in Moldava.\n\nAndrei Morari, by contrast, has become resigned towards politics. He grew up in Transnistria, a narrow strip of land between the Dniester River and the Ukrainian border. Transnistria longs for independence and receives support from Russia. The conflict has remained \"frozen\" since a short military conflict in 1992. The divide between Transnistria and the rest of Moldova runs deep. Andrei refused military service and is therefore barred from going back to his native Transnistria. But he sees no future for himself in the capital, Chi»ôinƒÉu, either. Distrustful of all politicians, he won‚Äôt be casting his vote at the end of September - instead, he plans to leave the country as soon as he can. \nVeaceslav Sclifos, aka DJ Wenzel, wants to stay. He's passionate about music and dreams of building a techno scene in his small hometown of Criuleni. Everyone in the area knows him as DJ Wenzel. Yet he is also struggling to make a living. His village is on the brink of extinction. Many young people have left, pushed away by the lack of jobs and uncertain futures. \n\nThe documentary captures the dilemmas facing Moldova's youth - as well as their search for creative ways to build a future in their native country.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #moldova \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Hour by hour, Borman reconstructs Anne's final days of freedom, revealing the complex web of political intrigue, personal rivalries, and shifting alliances that ultimately led to her downfall. Was Anne Boleyn guilty of betrayal - or betrayed herself by a king determined to rid himself of a queen who could no longer deliver an heir? From the royal court at Greenwich Palace to the dark corridors of the Tower of London, viewers are taken on a journey through the escalating tension of spring 1536. What really happened in the days before Anne's arrest? Did she conspire with her alleged lovers, or was she the victim of a calculated political coup led by Thomas Cromwell? Featuring original documents, newly uncovered evidence, and visits to key historical locations, this episode investigates the confession that sealed her fate, the men accused alongside her, and the last desperate letter Anne wrote to her husband, King Henry VIII.\n\nDo you love uncovering the past, exploring historic sites, and venturing to distant lands?

There are 1,500 cases per year ‚Äî with most victims killed by a partner or ex-partner.\n\nChristiane Gomes describes the moment when her partner came into the bathroom with a gun and shot her in the face: \"Where did all this blood come from?\" she thought. \"And what about the children?\" Despite being seriously injured, she survived. But even after eight operations, she still suffers from facial pain. She's also struggling to make ends meet as she raises her children alone. But there is still hope: A surgeon is treating her free of charge, and she gets support in meeting with other survivors of attempted femicide. Another woman, Carolina Magalh√£es, was found dead below her apartment building. A court case is ongoing, but her relatives are convinced that Carolina's then-partner killed her. Meanwhile, in Duque de Caxias near Rio de Janeiro, a police patrol is on the move to protect women who are under threat. The team also visits schools to educate young people about machismo in Brazilian culture, which is considered the main cause of femicide. Police officer Neuseli Pereira says that prevention is key to tackling the problem. Because even though violence against women is now punished more severely, the number of femicides continues to rise.

While acknowledging concerns about job displacement and societal equity, Matt believes this transformation will unleash unprecedented human creativity by putting the full power of computing in everyone's hands, moving beyond the current \"programming priesthood\" to universal access to computational problem-solving. \n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:24 LLMs as the new computers\n06:07 The future of language models: From silos to integration\n11:15 Open Source models &amp; the democratization of AI\n17:44 From programming priesthood to universal computing\n29:31 Challenges &amp; concerns\n44:53 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nMichael Feathers ‚Ä¢ AI Assisted Programming ‚Ä¢ https://leanpub.com/ai-assisted-programming\nMatthias Kalle Dalheimer &amp; Matt Welsh ‚Ä¢ Running Linux ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3YSwAIv\nAlex Castrounis ‚Ä¢ AI for People and Business ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3NYKKTo\nPhil Winder ‚Ä¢ Reinforcement Learning ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nKelleher &amp; Tierney ‚Ä¢ Data Science (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series) ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3AQmIRg\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#AI #LLM #LargeLanguageModels #AIAssistant #FutureOfComputing #RAG #RetrievalAugmentedGeneration #FutureOfCS #ComputerScience #Programming #AIFuture #TodayInTech #MattWelsh  #JulianWood\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Much of what he predicted has come true. And yet, his new book Here Comes the Sun is more hopeful than you might expect. That‚Äôs because, for the first time, we have a genuine alternative: Solar and wind energy are now the cheapest, fastest-growing sources of power on Earth. The revolution has already begun.\n\nThis week, Sean is joined by McKibben to talk about the peril and promise of this moment. They explore how close we are to catastrophe, why each fraction of a degree of warming matters, and how the fossil fuel industry is fighting a desperate last stand. They also discuss the politics of energy in the age of Trump, why Texas and Utah may hold surprising lessons, and how cheap, abundant power could transform not just the climate fight but democracy itself.\n\nThis episode was made in partnership with Vox's Future Perfect team.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The film, which was shot before and after the fall of the regime, shows why the dictatorship collapsed so quickly and what hopes Syrians have today.\n\nBashar al-Assad came to power in 2000, after the death of his father. Together with his western-influenced wife Asma, the couple seemed to embody a new beginning for the country. But reforms failed to materialize and when the population took to the streets during the Arab Spring, Bashar al-Assad quickly abandoned his progressive rhetoric. Peaceful demonstrations were met with bloody repression and poison gas attacks. Over 500,000 people were killed, more than 100,000 disappeared and at least six million Syrians were forced into exile.\n\nAmong them was the activist Bassam Ezzedine. In 2013, he documented the regime's poison gas attack on the Ghouta region. As a result, he had to flee with his family. His sister and her family remained in Syria and were cruelly punished. She was arrested and her children were taken away from her. \n\nAt the time of the first interview, Bassam, like the rest of the world, cannot know that the regime will soon fall and he will be able to return home. As the filming progresses, change comes at a fast pace.\n\nThe war waged by Bashar al-Assad against his own people has destroyed the country‚Äôs economic infrastructure. A few weeks before the fall of the regime, Syrian journalist Faysal risked his life to secretly film images of everyday life in Syria: starving children searching for food in the garbage, and endless queues outside bakeries. The country had been bled dry after 54 years of Assad rule. After months of preparation, the Syrian rebels launched a new offensive on 27 November 2024. Within 11 days, they ended the dictatorship - without encountering any serious resistance.\n\nThe new government promised an inclusive administration for all. But as Marie Forestier, Syria expert at the European Institute for Peace, explains: \"The real challenge for the new president is to broaden his base. Because so far he has relied exclusively on loyalists from Idlib, who are very conservative.\" And even after the overwhelming victory, the new government does not control the entire territory: in the south, the Israeli army has extended its occupation to the Golan Heights, while in the north, the Turks are bombing Kurdish-controlled areas on a massive scale.\n\nSyria is still unstable. However, the hopes and expectations of Syrians following more than 50 years of Assad rule are high.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #syria #assadregime\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A civil conflict that impacted the lives of so many, and would take the lives of thousands of soldiers who fought in it.\n\nBut look at the paintings from the period, the history books, broadway musicals and Hollywood depictions of this war, and you‚Äôd believe it to have been a chess match won by plucky patriots against out-of-touch, aristocratic generals.\n\nBeneath of all this was the reality, an arduous series of skirmishes, sieges and pitched battles fought between ordinary British regulars and loyalist troops against so-called rebel militias and Washington‚Äôs Continental Army. This would also be a war of attrition, a fight against the elements, and a true test of loyalty. \n\nSo what was life actually like for the average redcoat on the ground? In this series, in collaboration with Survive History, I‚Äôll be recruited into the 33rd Regiment of Foot, a proud military unit commanded by Lord Charles Cornwallis that took part in almost all major campaigns of the American War of Independence. \n\nUsing meticulous research and real soldiers‚Äô diaries, I‚Äôll discover how ordinary civilians in Britain could find themselves in the deep heartland of America within a matter of months, how they adjusted to the novel tactics used by the rebels, the extreme conditions in the colonies and what the chances were of them making it out alive‚Ä¶. \n\nMake sure to check out our full Revolutionary War Series Playlist to see both sides of the action! üëâhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf70RWw22YY&amp;list=PLPYbVPqV7je-bH-mJHk122VpIWOXPRcj4\n\nPART TWO COMING OUT IN OCTOBER\n\nCheck out 'The Pattern.

Telehealth can help.\n\nRural health care has been in crisis mode for decades due to a wide range of issues from distance to care to provider shortages and budget shortfalls. Rural residents may have to travel up to twice as far to access a hospital than those in urban areas. Staffing shortages mean that even when they do arrive they‚Äôre less likely to find the correct specialist. The American Medical Association reported that about 65 percent of rural areas have a shortage of primary care physicians. The list goes on, and despite multiple grants or special designations designed to help close these gaps, the issues persist. The reality is, rural areas need a range of options to better serve their communities. One that‚Äôs working right now is the use of telehealth to supplement care. The trouble is, telehealth is frequently overlooked and underfunded, but if used correctly, proponents say it could be a game changer for rural communities, where about 20 percent of Americans live. \n\nThanks to our sponsor, T-Mobile: http://t-mobile.com/FirstResponders.

The war is lost, but the killing continues. The once mighty Wehrmacht has been driven back on all fronts. In the west, Allied troops are poised to surge into the German heartland.\n\nTo the east, the Red Army continues its bloody march towards Berlin. The German war machine is on the brink of total collapse.\n\nIn the capital, as Goebbels prepares the German people for a final, desperate last stand, Hitler descends deeper into a world of fantasy.
