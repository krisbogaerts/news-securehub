This beta introduces improvements across installation, system tools, and programming languages while continuing Fedora's pattern of cleaning out older components. The beta can be downloaded in Workstation, KDE Plasma, Server, IoT, and Cloud editions. Spins and Labs are also available, though Mate and i3 are not provided in some builds. Existing systems can be upgraded with DNF system-upgrade. Fedora CoreOS will follow one week later through its \"next\" stream. The beta brings enhancements to its Anaconda WebUI, moves to Python 3.14, and supports Wayland-only GNOME, among many other changes. A full list of improvements and system enhancements can be found here.\n \nThe official release should be available in late October or early November.","contentLength":942,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Red Hat Back-Office Team Moving To IBM From 2026","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/09/09/0039236/red-hat-back-office-team-moving-to-ibm-from-2026?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1757412000,"author":"BeauHD","guid":284,"unread":true,"content":"Starting in 2026, Red Hat's back-office staff in HR, finance, legal, and accounting will be transferred to IBM, while engineering, product, sales, and marketing teams remain at Red Hat -- at least for now. The Register reports: According to a communication sent to employees, those in General &amp; Administrative areas will join IBM, including the lion's share of the people working in the HR, finance, accounting, and legal units at Red Hat. A source told us the switch will be \"implemented this year,\" although in some countries \"it might take longer due to legal constraints.\" The leadership running those teams will remain within the Red Hat fold. Some are nervous about the move, with tech companies -- notably IBM -- eliminating duplicated roles to consolidate back-office functions. In January -- as has happened in recent years -- IBM again forecast annual savings of $3.5 billion, partly through job cuts.\n \nThere is no public data on the size of the G&amp;A population within Red Hat but the total workforce is understood to be about 19,000 worldwide, with the bulk of those employed in the engineering, sales, and support divisions. The team remaining at Red Hat will be part of the central Strategy &amp; Operations group managed by Mike Ferris. As such, engineering, product, sales, and marketing personnel will be unaffected. For now at least. \"Culture has been dead for at least 1 year now,\" said Reddit user Purple_Afternoon 966. \"The experience might be different depending on the department, but there is nothing left from the open culture praised. We have now micromanagement, decision making from middle management that clearly have no idea of what we do and how and trying to implement ideas that they read somewhere, with no context, data and not giving answer or addressing feedback.\"","contentLength":1796,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Linus Torvalds Expresses Frustration With 'Garbage' Link Tags In Git Commits","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/09/07/177225/linus-torvalds-expresses-frustration-with-garbage-link-tags-in-git-commits?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1757270040,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":283,"unread":true,"content":"\"I have not pulled this, I'm annoyed by having to even look at this, and if you actually expect me to pull this I want a real explanation and not a useless link,\" Linus Torvalds posted Friday on the Linux kernel mailing list. \nPhoronix explains:\n\n\nIt's become a common occurrence seeing \"Link: \" tags within Git commits for the Linux kernel that point to the latest Linux kernel mailing list patches of the same patch... Linus Torvalds has had enough and will be more strict against accepting pull requests that have link tags of no value. He commented yesterday on a block pull request that he pulled and then backed out of: \n\n\"And dammit, this commit has that promising 'Link:' argument that I hoped would explain why this pointless commit exists, but AS ALWAYS that link only wasted my time by pointing to the same damn information that was already there. I was hoping that it would point to some oops report or something that would explain why my initial reaction was wrong. \n\n\"Stop this garbage already. Stop adding pointless Link arguments that waste people's time. Add the link if it has *ADDITIONAL* information.... \n\n\"Yes, I'm grumpy. I feel like my main job — really my only job — is to try to make sense of pull requests, and that's why I absolutely detest these things that are automatically added and only make my job harder.\" \nA longer discussion ensued...\n\n\n Torvalds: [A] \"perfect\" model might be to actually have some kind of automation of \"unless there was actual discussion about it\". But I feel such a model might be much too complicated, unless somebody *wants* to explore using AI because their job description says \"Look for actual useful AI uses\". In today's tech world, I assume such job descriptions do exist. Sigh...\n\n Torvalds: I do think it makes sense for patch series that (a) are more than a small handful of patches and (b) have some real \"story\" to them (ie a cover letter that actually explains some higher-level issues)...\n\n\n\nTorvalds also had two responses to a poster who'd said \"IMHO it's better to have a Link and it _potentially_ being useful than not to have it and then need to search around for it.\"\n\n\n Torvalds: No. Really. The issue is \"potentially — but very likely not — useful\" vs \"I HIT THIS TEN+ TIMES EVERY SINGLE F%^&amp; RELEASE\". \nThere is just no comparison. I have literally *never* found the original submission email to be useful, and I'm tired of the \"potentially useful\" argument that has nothing to back it up with. It's literally magical thinking of \"in some alternate universe, pigs can fly, and that link might be useful\"\n\n Torvalds: And just to clarify: the hurt is real. It's not just the disappointment. It's the wasted effort of following a link and having to then realize that there's nothing useful there. Those links *literally* double the effort for me when I try to be careful about patches... \n\nThe cost is real. The cost is something I've complained about before... Yes, it's literally free to you to add this cost. No, *YOU* don't see the cost, and you think it is helpful. It's not. It's the opposite of helpful. So I want commit messages to be relevant and explain what is going on, and I want them to NOT WASTE MY TIME. \n\nAnd I also don't want to ignore links that are actually *useful* and give background information. Is that really too much to ask for?\n\n\nTorvalds points out he's brought this up four times before — once in 2022.\n\n\n Torvalds: I'm a bit frustrated, exactly because this _has_ been going on for years. It's not a new peeve. \n\nAnd I don't think we have a good central place for that kind of \"don't do this\". Yes, there's the maintainer summit, but that's a pretty limited set of people. I guess I could mention it in my release notes, but I don't know who actually reads those either.. So I end up just complaining when I see it.\n","contentLength":3833,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Firefox Ending 32-bit Linux Support Next Year","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/09/05/199223/firefox-ending-32-bit-linux-support-next-year?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1757112000,"author":"BeauHD","guid":282,"unread":true,"content":"Mozilla announced today that they will end 32-bit Linux support for Firefox in 2026, with version 144 being the last release and ESR 140 as the fallback option.
