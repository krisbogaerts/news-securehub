Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by registering expired or unregistered domains that were previously owned by legitimate entities.\n\nBut: How can security researchers and penetration testers efficiently identify these dead domains?\n\nSome time ago, I stumbled over S√ºleyman √áelikarslan‚Äôs (@slymn\\_clkrsln) tweets about second order domain takeover vulnerabilities. This inspired me to create two tools that can help identify dead domains:\n\nBoth tools aim to assist security researchers and penetration testers in discovering expired or unregistered domains _on the fly_. After achieving good results with the Chrome extension, I noticed that the ‚Äúright‚Äù place to catch dead domains would probably be at the DNS level. Hence, I developed the UDP DNS forwarder.\n\n## Dead Domain Discovery - Chrome Extension\n\nThe Chromium extensions aims to identify abandoned domains that are referenced by a website for instance within an iFrame, as script or as CSS source. The extension adds a small content script to each visited page that scans for such references using a call to dns.google.com. If a domain appears to be unregistered or expired, a notification is shown to the user using Chrome‚Äôs notification API. The extension uses manifest version 3 and is open source.\n\nThe recommended path for installation is via the Chrome Web Store.\n\nAlternatively, you can also install the extension manually by following the instructions in the GitHub repository.\n\n## Dead Domain Discovery DNS - DNS Forwarder\n\nThe Dead Domain Discovery DNS tool is a lightweight UDP DNS forwarder that highlights potentially expired or unregistered domains by watching for unanswered lookups. The server retries queries against secondary upstream resolvers, keeps a cooldown window to avoid noisy alerts, and reports findings through multiple channels.\n\nThe tool is built in Python makes use of the dnslib library for DNS packet handling. It can be easily integrated into existing penetration testing setups or used as a standalone service. I use it as my primary DNS server in my home setup to catch dead domains while browsing the web or performing security assessments. It is leightweight and efficient, making it suitable for continuous monitoring. I would recommend to run it on a Raspberry Pi or similar low-power devices.\n\nYou can find the repository and installation instructions on GitHub.\n\nIf you have any comments or questions, please feel free to reach out via Mastodon, Twitter or LinkedIn. üôÇ</article>","contentLength":2697,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"CVE-2025-11755 - Delicious Recipes <= 1.9.0 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary File Upload","url":"https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11755","date":1761981335,"author":"","guid":3754,"unread":true,"content":"<article>CVE-2025-11755\n Nov. 1, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 12&nbsp;hours, 30&nbsp;minutes ago\nThe WP Delicious ‚Äì Recipe Plugin for Food Bloggers (formerly Delicious Recipes) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads when importing recipes via CSV in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.0.
