This happens when the encoding of the application (e.g. UTF-8) is wider than that of the database (e.g. ASCII).\n\nLooking to improve your skills? Discover our **trainings** sessions! Learn more.\n\n\n## What is MySQL strict SQL mode?\n\nStrict mode\\[1\\] controls how MySQL handles invalid or missing values in data-change statements such as `INSERT` or `UPDATE`. The case detailed in this article is when the value is out of range. What happens when a value is invalid for the current encoding?\n\nAn over-simplification of the strict mode in this case:\n\nStrict mode On\n\nStrict mode Off\n\nError\n\nWarning (silent)\n\nNothing modified\n\nInsert “adjusted” value (“closest values”)\n\nAt this point, you guessed what could go wrong.\n\n## Set and check\n\nIn fact, there is no “strict mode” that is “on” or “off”. There is a system variable named `sql_mode` that contains an array of values. If that array contains one of `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` or `STRICT_ALL_TABLES` values or the combination mode `TRADITIONAL`, then MySQL is in “strict mode”.\n\nThe documentation for MySQL 9.1\\[2\\] claims that the default value of `sql_mode` is the following.\n\n```\nONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY STRICT_TRANS_TABLES NO_ZERO_IN_DATE NO_ZERO_DATE ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\n```\n\nThe default value may differ on other versions or alternative backend engines such as MariaDB or Percona Server. The `@@sql_mode` system variable allows to query the current value.\n\n```\n[u]&gt; SELECT @@sql_mode\\G; @@sql_mode: STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\n```\n\nInstallation programs may configure the SQL mode during the installation process. So even if the strict mode is enabled by default, XAMPP, CMS, etc. may silently disable it.\n\nThe violent method to disable strict mode (and everything else) is:\n\n```\nSET sql_mode='';\n```\n\n## Observations\n\nLet's create a table using ASCII encoding where it is easy to insert invalid values and see what happens when the strict mode is on and off.\n\n```\n-- Create a table with a column using a narrow space encoding on purpose CREATE TABLE uni_sandbox ( id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, data VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET ascii ); -- Strict mode enabled SET sql_mode='STRICT_ALL_TABLES'; INSERT INTO uni_sandbox (data) VALUES ('I ♥ Unicode'); -- =&gt; ERROR 1366 (22007): Incorrect string value: '\\xE2\\x99\\xA5 Un...' for column `unicode8`.`uni_sandbox`.`data` at row 1 -- Strict mode disabled SET sql_mode=''; INSERT INTO uni_sandbox (data) VALUES ('I ♥ Unicode'); SELECT * FROM uni_sandbox\\G; -- =&gt; data: I ? Unicode\n```\n\nWith strict mode on, an error was triggered, with strict mode off, the data was inserted but `♥` was replaced by `?`. Oracle MySQL or MariaDB documentation says “convert the invalid value to the closest valid value” without explaining exactly how it works. In practice, strings longer than the column size will be truncated, integers rounded to the nearest values, but that is only for values that are overflowing. For values that are invalid (can't be represented in the encoding), each byte is replaced with a `?`.\n\n## Attack context\n\nImagine the following context: there is a web application, that is strictlly checking the user input. A generic method commonly used for validation is by using regular expressions (RegExp). Independently of the language, nearly all RegExp engines supports POSIX character classes. But years ago, with the generalization of the Unicode support, many engines extended the range of those classes to work on Unicode too (originally limited to ASCII). So for example, instead of matching alphanumeric characters only on the ASCII range ( `A-Za-z0-9`), it will also match characters from the corresponding Unicode categories like Letter ( `L`) and Number ( `N`) by default.\n\nTake the following example in Ruby with the character Latin Letter Bidental Percussive `ʭ`.\n\n```\n/[[:alnum:]]/.match('ʭ') # =&gt; #</article>","contentLength":4179,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Nvidia and Adobe vulnerabilities","url":"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/nvidia-and-adobe-vulnerabilities/","date":1759343935,"author":"Kri Dontje","guid":307,"unread":true,"content":"<article>This website is using a security service to protect itself from online attacks.

It was first advertised by the actor “kingcrete2022.” From the outset, its design showed the hallmarks of experienced developers, and analysis soon revealed that it drew heavily from an earlier project by the same authors, Hidden Bee \\[1\\]. This strong foundation helped Rhadamanthys quickly gain traction: from a niche product, it grew into one of the dominant stealers in cybercrime campaigns and has even attracted interest from more advanced threat actors.\n\nSince its appearance, Check Point Research (CPR) has been closely tracking its development, noting constant updates and customization options. In previous publications, we explored the breadth of its features, internal design, and the execution flow of its components using v0.5 as an example. Much of that work remains relevant today, as the core architecture has stayed intact.\n\nHowever, with the release of v0.9.x, Rhadamanthys introduced changes that broke some of our previously published tools, including the custom format converter and string deobfuscator. This was a clear sign that the family had reached another milestone update, one significant enough to warrant a fresh analysis. In this blog, we present our findings on the latest release, v0.9.2.\n\nIt is worth noting that the initial loader of Rhadamanthys comes in multiple variants: it can be a .NET executable or a native Windows executable (32- or 64-bit). The main target of our analysis is the execution chain started by the native version. Although the first stage varies, the later stages are identical for all loader types.\n\nRhadamanthys was initially promoted through posts on cybercrime forums, but soon it became clear that the author had a more ambitious plan to connect with potential customers and build visibility. In parallel, they launched a Telegram support channel, a Tor website with detailed product descriptions, and offered communication via Tox. Most recently, the website underwent a complete makeover, presenting a polished and professional image. The operators now brand themselves as “RHAD security” and “Mythical Origin Labs.”\n\nThe new site showcases all of their products, including teasers for those still in development. Alongside Rhadamanthys – their flagship stealer – they also advertise&nbsp;_Elysium Proxy Bot_&nbsp;and a&nbsp;_Crypt Service_. Version updates are also listed, though this section is not always up to date with actual releases.\n\nAs before, Rhadamanthys is offered in tiered packages: from $299 per month for a self-hosted version, to $499 per month with a rented server and additional benefits. A special Enterprise tier, with individually negotiated pricing, is also available.\n\nThe combination of the branding, product portfolio, and pricing structure suggest that the authors treat Rhadamanthys as a long-term business venture rather than a side project.\n\nFor defenders, this professionalization signals that Rhadamanthys with its growing customer base and an expanding ecosystem is likely here to stay, making it important to track not only its malware updates but also the business infrastructure that sustains it.\n\nThe release of version 0.9 was announced in February 2025, followed by subsequent updates 0.9.1 and 0.9.2. The official website, however, still lists only 0.9.1 (released in May). Its changelog includes a long list of updates, reproduced below:\n\n```\nv0.9.1 (2025-05-18) - Redesigned database operation process, separated read and write operations. Ensures data write integrity - User management permission levels, introduced new worker, traffic merchant, removed observer mode - Optimized file packaging and CPU usage when exporting to directory. Significantly reduced log packaging export speed - TOR removed random address generation, fixed address permanently effective - Management login added 2FA OTP login verification - Client and task plugins, introduced memory mutex throughout the process, suppressing multiple executions on the same machine sending duplicate data - Client loading introduced tracking system, can interface with user's loading program. Program startup and data collection work will trigger WEBHOOK callback - When generating client files, directly select tags from list, generated files named by build tags - Support using multiple server lists for client building - Support relay jump page, real server URL encrypted stored in jump page - Build stub completely removed registry write operations, X64 version, added process injection switch, can choose self-process injection and new process injection - Task execution conditions added HWID condition - LOG display pagination list added log total count display - LOG list page added download count flag block - FILE download added, one-click package all exported logs into a compressed package, convenient for download - Telegram message template, added new filter categories - Added shim server work detection, 5 minutes offline, sends Telegram message notification - Fixed delete duplicate LOG function, keeps latest record - Fixed search function, fixed time search function - Agrent_X wallet, changed to Argent - a Kepler wallet changed to Keplr - API interface changes, added new API interfaces - Get device fingerprint information, added browser fingerprint information collection - Build stub redesigned, higher stability and reliability - Added nonascii: true configuration, supporting non-ASCII character password filtering\n```\n\nSeveral entries stand out, including the introduction of a global mutex to suppress duplicate executions, expanded process injection options, and a redesigned build stub. These indicate modifications to the core modules.\n\nVersion 0.9.2, released a few months later and already gaining traction, is not yet listed on the website.\n\nAs always, such changelogs are written for customers and do not fully capture the points of greatest interest to researchers. However, they still provide useful hints about which areas of the stealer have changed. In the following sections, we present the results of our analysis and highlight the modifications we confirmed, together with several changes that were not documented in the public notes.\n\nThe first thing that stands out in the updated release (0.9.2) is the introduction of a new message box that appears at the start of the malware. We encounter it as soon as we unpack the initial executable.\n\nIt’s a well-known fact is that most malware is distributed in a protective layer, meant to thwart static detection. The usual first step of analysis is to remove it and reach the core executable (it can be done automatically, i.e. with the help of tools like PE-sieve/HollowsHunter). Interestingly, after unpacking the latest Rhadamanthys (0.9.2), as we try to run the obtained executable, the warning message shows up, saying: “Do you want to run a malware? (Crypt build to disable this message)”.\n\nThis message box is familiar to anyone who has ever analyzed the famous Lumma stealer (more info: here \\[5\\]).\n\nIn the past, the Lumma stealer introduced a check aimed at preventing malware distributors from spreading the initial executable in its plain, unprotected form, which can be easily detected. It was also preventing unskilled distributors from getting their own machine infected. The malware checks the file from which it is deployed, and if it found familiar patterns at the defined offsets, it recognizes that it is running from the raw, unpacked sample. In such cases, instead of running malicious actions immediately, a pop-up is displayed, asking the user for permission to continue. An identical check is now performed by Rhadamanthys.\n\nAt first glance, it may appear that both malware families share the same code, responsible for displaying the message. But upon closer inspection, we can see that completely different APIs are called along the way. In Lumma, opening and reading the file is implemented via raw syscalls, and the message box is executed via&nbsp;`NtRaiseHardError`.\n\nIn Rhadamanthys, raw syscalls aren’t used, and the same message box is displayed by&nbsp;`MessageBoxW`.\n\nBoth loaders are obfuscated, but the obfuscation patterns are different. In the case of the Rhadamanthys loader, the APIs used are static, but the code blocks that call them are disconnected – this obfuscation pattern reminds of some LLVM-based obfuscators.\n\nIn contrast, Lumma code is much more coherent and can be decompiled. The important functions are called via syscalls, using a single proxy function:\n\nTherefore, despite the surface-level similarity, it seems to be just a behavioral mimicry. We don’t have any proof of links between the Lumma development group and Rhadamanthys; however, it is possible that after Europol’s operation earlier this year, some members of the original Lumma team joined the promising competitor.\n\nThis message box occurs in the Stage 1 executable. Typically for Rhadamanthys, this executable runs a shellcode in memory, which loads Stage 2, that consist of multiple modules. Its core modules are implemented in a format proprietary to this malware that we denote as XS.\n\nSince its inception, Rhadamanthys has shipped its executable modules in custom formats rather than the standard PEs. Only the first stage (the initial component), is a typical Windows executable. Its role is to prepare and deploy the set of components, that are unpacked from the internal package.\n\nCustom formats preserve all the essential components of an executable, such as relocations, import tables, and sections with access rights – but this information is stored in headers fully reinvented by the authors. Unlike PE or ELF files, which are natively supported by the operating systems, custom executables require proprietary loaders. This acts as a form of obfuscation, as standard tools can’t parse them. In addition, the absence of expected headers makes it more difficult to dump those components from memory, and reconstruct them.\n\nThe evolution of the custom formats used by Rhadamanthys was described in detail in our earlier work&nbsp;_From Hidden Bee to Rhadamanthys_, along with a tool to convert them into PE for easier study (available here). Since version 0.5, Rhadamanthys modules used formats starting with the magic value&nbsp;`XS`. Two subtypes exist, used at different stages of execution (details outlined&nbsp;here):\n\nIn v0.9.x, both formats received updates, which we label&nbsp;**XS1\\_B**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**XS2\\_B**.\n\nThe first subtype (XS1) contains an extended header, with a field denoting the version number. The current variant is version 4, a direct increment over the previously described one.\n\nThe header of the XS1\\_B can be described by the following structure:\n\n```\n#pragma pack(push, 1) // Adjust to one byte typedef struct { WORD magic; WORD nt_magic; WORD sections_count; **//WORD imp_key; &lt;- removed** WORD hdr_size; BYTE ver; **BYTE imp_key; // &lt;- added here** DWORD module_size; DWORD entry_point; t_XS_data_dir data_dir[XS_DATA_DIR_COUNT]; t_XS_section sections; } t_XS_format_B; #pragma pack(pop) // Back to the previous settings\n```\n\nThe major change that we can observe is a lack of the WORD field before the header size. In the previous version (XS1\\_A) this field stood for the key that was used for deobfuscating the names of the DLLs, used in the custom Import Table. Now this field is removed, because the deobfuscating algorithm has been replaced with the new one:\n\n```\nbool decode_name_B(BYTE* dll_name, size_t name_len) { if (!name_len) { return false; } BYTE out_name[128] = { 0 }; size_t indx = 0; size_t pos = 0; size_t flag = 0; for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; name_len; ++i) { BYTE outC = 0; for (WORD round = 7; round &gt; 0; round--) { BYTE val = dll_name[indx]; if (pos) { flag = (val &gt;&gt; (7 - pos)) &amp; 1; if (pos == 7) { pos = 0; ++indx; } else { ++pos; } } else { flag = val &gt;&gt; 7; pos = 1; } outC |= (flag != 0) &lt;&lt; (round - 1); } if (!is_valid_dll_char(outC)) { return false; } out_name[i] = outC; } out_name[name_len] = 0; ::memcpy(dll_name, out_name, name_len); return true; }\n```\n\nStill, the malware uses an import deobfuscation key ( `imp_key`) to resolve imported functions. This time the key is shorter, only one BYTE long. It is used in&nbsp;calculating checksums&nbsp;that are then mapped to particular functions’ names.\n\nThe next stage format (XS2\\_B) underwent some lighter modifications. The only thing that changed was one of the fields in the custom import structure: it was extended from WORD to DWORD. This field carries the name of the DLL. In the past it could be carried in an obfuscated form, now it is used as is.\n\n```\n#pragma pack(push, 1) // Adjust to one byte typedef struct { DWORD dll_name_rva; DWORD first_thunk; DWORD original_first_thunk; **DWORD obf_dll_len; //WORD obf_dll_len;** } t_XS_import_B; #pragma pack(pop) // Back to the previous settings\n```\n\nAs we can see, the changes do not add any new qualities to the format. The most likely role of the restructuring is to invalidate earlier parsers. It reflects the ongoing pattern of incremental churn aimed at slowing analysts down.\n\nAll the changes are now reflected in the updates to our tool, and the new modules can be successfully converted into PE.\n\nThe Stage 2 core, implemented as an XS1 module, starts its execution with various checks that are used to decide if the malware should continue its execution. Most of them have not changed since earlier versions. However, some underwent makeovers.\n\nIn the past, in consecutive versions of Rhadamanthys, it used the&nbsp;`SibCode`&nbsp;registry keys in order to save the timestamp of the last execution. Depending on the version, the keys may look like one of the following:\n\n `HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\SibCode\\sn` `HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\SibCode\\sn2` `HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\SibCode\\sn3`\n\nIt was introduced to prevent the sample from being executed again too quickly after the first deployment. While initially the timestamp was saved as a single DWORD, in consecutive releases the author put more effort into making it tamper-proof. It was described in detail in \\[4\\] under “Re-Execution Delay Feature”. The presence of this registry key was one of the easy-to-notice symptoms of Rhadamanthys infection. This is probably the reason why the author gave it up completely, mentioning in the 0.9.1 changelog:&nbsp;_“Build stub completely removed registry write operations”_ **.**&nbsp;Indeed by checking the code we can confirm that the relevant function is now absent.\n\nIn the earlier releases, Rhadamanthys used to create its mutex in a somewhat repeatable manner, based on a hash made of hardcoded values. This allowed researchers to create a universal vaccine (described in \\[4\\]). Now, the author decided to evade this simple way of preventing the malware from running.\n\nSince 0.9, the Rhadamanthys configuration (described further) includes a 16-byte seed value that participates in mutex name generation. It is hashed along with the magic&nbsp;`XRHY`. The first 16 bytes of the hash are then split into chunks and formatted into the Mutex name:\n\nPossible format strings for the generation of mutexes:\n\n```\n\"Global\\MSCTF.Asm.{%08x-%04x-%04x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x}\" \"Session\\%u\\MSCTF.Asm.{%08x-%04x-%04x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x}\" \"MSCTF.Asm.{%08x-%04x-%04x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x}\"\n```\n\nIf creation of the first mutex option fails, the second is applied, with an index after “Session” that can be in the range 1-8.\n\nDepending on the flags set in the configuration, the mutex can be passed into all the processes where Rhadamanthys injects its modules (by duplicating the handle). This feature is enabled by default and disabled if the flag&nbsp;`0x40`&nbsp;or&nbsp;`0x20`&nbsp;is set. Knowing this, we can search for the handle of the mutex in other processes, to check which belong to the same Rhadamanthys execution tree.\n\nThe main Rhadamanthys module is shipped with an obfuscated configuration, which is decrypted and parsed at the beginning of the execution. It contains the C2 address, encryption keys used along the way, and various flags that specify which features of the malware will be enabled or disabled. This configuration has evolved considerably across consecutive versions. The explanation of the used fields in a relatively new version (0.7) has been provided in \\[4\\].\n\nThe magic&nbsp;`0x59485221`&nbsp;(&nbsp;`!RHY`&nbsp;) has been used by this malware since the beginning of its existence. However, in the recent version 0.9.2, it is replaced with the&nbsp;`0xBEEF`&nbsp;DWORD (first noted&nbsp;here). Also, the configuration content has been significantly extended.\n\nThe unpacked configuration, starting with&nbsp;`0xBEEF`&nbsp;markers, is not the final version but a compressed form. After the appropriate arguments are fetched, LZO decompression is applied. The result looks as follows:\n\nWhile in the past the config allowed one C2 per sample, multiple options are now allowed. Example:\n\n```\nhxxps://193.233.126.43/gateway/iesm4j25.s4pj7 hxxps://193.23.216.48/gateway/iesm4j25.s4pj7\n```\n\nStructure illustrating the new config (after decompression):\n\n```\nstruct config_new { DWORD flags; DWORD unk0; BYTE aes_iv[16]; BYTE mutex_seed[16]; BYTE unk1[18]; WORD padding; BYTE urls[256]; };\n```\n\nAs in the previous version, the configuration is stored in the main sample as a Base64 string, encoded with a custom charset. In the current version, the charset used is:&nbsp;`4NOPQRSTUVWXY567DdeEqrstuvwxyz-ABC1fghop23Fijkbc|lmnGHIJKLMZ089a`.\n\nLayers of config deobfuscation before the&nbsp;`0xBEEF`&nbsp;config blob is obtained are:\n\nAfter that, the configuration is decompressed with LZO algorithm.\n\nThis model of configuration was also observed in the version 0.9, and 0.9.1. While 0.9.2 changed the marker to&nbsp;`0xBEEF`, the older variants continued to use the known&nbsp;`RHY!`.\n\nThe config contains the field&nbsp;`flags`&nbsp;values of which are used to off and on some possible execution paths. Overview:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the important modules of the malware are stored in an internal package and retrieved on demand.\n\nIn the past versions, modules were fetched from the package by their names, or even full paths relative to the internal filesystem. This made researchers’ job easier, since we were able to infer functionality just by looking at the name. Now the authors has moved toward obfuscation and has hidden the names. The modules are represented by checksums.\n\nThe reconstructed package structure (Stage 2):\n\n```\ntypedef struct DATA_DIR { struct { uint32_t header_rel_off; uint32_t checksum; }; } _DATA_DIR; typedef struct DATA_RECORD { struct { uint32_t size; uint8_t offset[1]; }; } _DATA_RECORD; typedef struct PACKAGE { uint32_t total_size; uint16_t reserved; uint16_t xor_key; uint32_t dir_offset; uint16_t data_offset; uint8_t file_count; uint8_t blk_shift; _DATA_DIR dir[1]; } _PACKAGE;\n```\n\nWhenever modules are about to be retrieved, the raw package, that is shipped as hardcoded in the initial executable, is first decrypted and decompressed. Each time it is done, a fresh XOR key is set for the obfuscation of the modules. We can observe this inside the `decode_package`&nbsp;function:\n\nOnce the key is generated, the decompressed content of the package is obfuscated, using a simple XOR-based obfuscation. This way, the authors try to minimize the content that is exposed to memory dumping tools.\n\n```\nvoid xor_based_enc_dec( const uint8_t* src, std::size_t size, uint8_t* dst, uint16_t key) { for (std::size_t i = 0; i &lt; size; ++i) { dst[i] = src[i] ^ static_cast</article>","contentLength":19514,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["vulns"]}
