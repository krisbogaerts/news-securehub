data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Pope Leo XIV has hit out at those who minimise the \"increasingly evident\" impact of rising temperatures in his first major statement on climate change.</p><p>Reiterating the words of his predecessor Pope Francis, the new pontiff lambasted critics who \"ridicule those who speak of global warming\".</p><p>The Pope's remarks, at a speech in Castel Gondolfo near Rome, will be seen as an implied criticism of US President Donald Trump, who last month called climate change a \"con\".</p><p>Pope Leo also called for greater action from citizens the world over on climate change, saying there was no room for indifference or resignation.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>The Pope was speaking at a conference to mark 10 years since the publication of Laudato Si'.</p><p>That <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html\">landmark document</a>, written by his predecessor Pope Francis, made the issue of climate a central part of the church's concerns.</p><p>Many credit it for helping set the tone that led to the Paris climate agreement in 2015.</p><p>But the new Pope, who was elected in May, was worried that the question of climate change was now becoming more divisive.</p><p>Referring to his predecessor's writings, he said: \"Some have chosen to deride the increasingly evident signs of climate change, to ridicule those who speak of global warming, and even to blame the poor for the very thing that affects them the most.\"</p><p>Just two weeks ago at the UN General Assembly in New York, US President Donald Trump criticised the climate movement as the \"greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\", and rebuffed the use of renewable energy.</p><p>\"The carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions, and they're heading down a path of total destruction,\" he said.</p><p>Pope Leo, the first pontiff born in the US, has previously clashed with Trump's White House on issues including migration and national security.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>In Wednesday's speech, the Pope called for people all over the world to put increased pressure on politicians.</p><p>Citizens need to take an active role in political decisions, he said, as \"only then will it be possible to mitigate the damage done to the environment\".</p><p>The Pope said that each of us will have to answer a question from God.</p><p>\"God will ask us if we have cultivated and cared for the world that he created for the benefit of all and for future generations, and if we have taken care of our brothers and sisters - what will be our answer, my dear friends?\"</p><p>The Raising Hope conference was held just over a month from the start of COP30 in Belém, in Brazil.</p><p>World leaders and climate diplomats will meet in the Amazonian city as efforts to tackle rising emissions of planet warming gases have fallen down the political agenda.</p><p>Brazilian Environment Minister Marina Silva invited the Pope to COP30 on behalf of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.</p><p>\"I am convinced in this way His Holiness will make an indispensable contribution so that COP30 may go down in history as the great moment of implementation,\" she said.</p><p>Today's meeting also heard from former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who said the Pope was a real world \"action hero\", as he had committed to putting solar panels on all the Vatican's buildings.</p></div>","contentLength":3105,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1nwfm7p/pope_leo_condemns_climate_change_critics/"},{"title":"UK's

The Wall Street Journal first&nbsp;reported&nbsp;the request.&nbsp;\nThe Trump administration has not made a decision regarding the demand, and it’s one in a long list of asks from the Chinese side under consideration, according to a separate person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. A State Department fact sheet on US ties with Taiwan is&nbsp;currently&nbsp;unavailable on its website.&nbsp;\nLanguage defining the US relationship with Taiwan has long been a sensitive subject. In February, after the State Department abruptly&nbsp;removed&nbsp;from its website a phrase saying the US does “not support Taiwan independence,” Beijing swiftly urged Washington to “correct its wrongdoings.” Prior to that, the Biden administration removed the phrase in May 2022 but reinstated it after Chinese officials protested.\nChina’s Foreign Ministry spokesman&nbsp;Guo Jiakun&nbsp;reiterated Beijing’s position on Taiwan when asked Monday at a regular briefing in Beijing about the Chinese request. “Upholding the ‘one China principle’ absolutely entails opposing Taiwanese independence,” he said.\n--------\nMore on Bloomberg Television and Markets\n \nLike this video?

Signal is considered one of the most secure messengers.</p><p data-t-name=\"Paragraph\">\"If we were faced with the choice of either undermining the integrity of our encryption and our data protection guarantees or leaving Europe, we would unfortunately make the decision to leave the market,\" Meredith Whittaker told the German Press Agency (dpa). The data protection expert is President of the non-profit Signal Foundation in the USA, which develops Signal.</p><p data-t-name=\"Paragraph\">The European Union has been discussing a law for three years that is intended to regulate the fight against depictions of child sexual abuse. The proposal for a corresponding regulation stipulates that messengers such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram and Threema should allow content to be checked before it is encrypted. To this end, the apps would have to include a control mechanism that can check all content.</p><h2>\"Not only the good guys have access to a backdoor\"</h2><p data-t-name=\"Paragraph\">Whittaker said Signal would never undermine the integrity of its end-to-end encryption. \"It guarantees the privacy of millions and millions of people around the world, often in life-threatening situations.\" This is why Signal rejects chat control. \"It's unfortunate that politicians continue to fall prey to a kind of magical thinking that assumes you can create a backdoor that only the good guys can access.\"</p><p data-t-name=\"Paragraph\">In the debate on chat control in the EU, the European Parliament had opposed such plans - with a broad majority across all political camps. In the Council of Member States, on the other hand, there was a majority in favor of chat control. However, without Germany and a few other countries, the plans could not be implemented here either. This could now change under the Danish Council Presidency.</p><h2>Unclear position of the German government</h2><p data-t-name=\"Paragraph\">It will be important to see how Germany positions itself. The coalition agreement of the black-red federal government states: \"We will combat discrimination in the digital space and protect fundamental digital rights. In principle, we will safeguard the confidentiality of private communication and anonymity online.\" However, the word \"in principle\" indicates that exceptions to this principle may be permitted. Critics fear that this will also make it possible to install backdoors in WhatsApp, Signal and co.</p><p data-t-name=\"Paragraph\">Signal CEO Whittaker said that in the worst case scenario, they would work with partners and the community to see if they could find ways to circumvent these rules. Signal also did this when the app was blocked in Russia or Iran. \"But ultimately, we would leave the market before we had to comply with dangerous laws like these.\"</p><h2>Warning about the AI agents</h2><p data-t-name=\"Paragraph\">In the interview with dpa, Whittaker also warned against the use of so-called AI agents, i.e. software robots with artificial intelligence that travel the internet on behalf of the user and independently take care of things such as booking a table in a restaurant or coordinating appointments with friends. \"These AI agents require enormous access options and almost unlimited authorizations. This gives them access to important applications and services - from the calendar to the email account, the Signal app or the credit card.\"</p><p data-t-name=\"Paragraph\">In order for apps such as Signal to be able to effectively defend themselves against spying, the manufacturers of the operating systems for computers and cell phones - i.e. Microsoft with Windows, Google with Android and Apple especially with iOS for the iPhone - now have a duty.

While there is no prohibition on Chinese ownership in U.S. military contractors, such investment is heavily regulated and the issue is treated by <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/america-first-investment-policy/\">the U.S. government</a> as a significant national security concern.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"4.0\">“They obviously have Chinese investors to be honest,” Iqbaljit Kahlon, a major SpaceX investor, said in a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26175242-kahlon-6172024-deposition/\">deposition</a> last year, adding that some are “directly on the cap table.” “Cap table” refers to the company’s capitalization table, which lists its shareholders.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"5.0\">Kahlon’s testimony does not reveal the scope of Chinese investment in SpaceX or the identities of the investors. Kahlon has long been close with the company’s leadership and runs his own firm that acts as a middleman for wealthy investors looking to buy shares of SpaceX.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"7.0\">SpaceX keeps its full ownership structure secret. It was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66857e1e-a217-4ddd-8332-d9f0f75aa459\">previously reported</a> that some Chinese investors had bought indirect stakes in SpaceX, investing in middleman funds that in turn owned shares in the rocket company. The new testimony describes direct investments that suggest a closer relationship with SpaceX.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"9.0\">SpaceX has thrived as it snaps up sensitive U.S. government contracts, from building spy satellites for the Pentagon to launching spacecraft for NASA. U.S. embassies and the White House have connected to the company’s Starlink internet service too. Musk’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/\">roughly 42%</a> stake in the company is worth an estimated $168 billion. If he owned nothing else, he’d be one of the 10 richest people in the world.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"11.0\">National security law experts said federal officials would likely be deeply interested in understanding the direct Chinese investment in SpaceX. Whether there was cause for concern would depend on the details, they said, but the U.S. government has asserted that China has a systematic strategy of using investments in sensitive industries to conduct espionage.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"12.0\">If the investors got access to nonpublic information about the company — say, details on its contracts or supply chain — it could be useful to Chinese intelligence, said Sarah Bauerle Danzman, an Indiana University professor who has worked for the State Department scrutinizing foreign investments. That “would create huge risks that, if realized, would have huge consequences for national security,” she said.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"13.0\">SpaceX did not respond to questions for this story. Kahlon declined to comment.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"14.0\">The new court records come from litigation in Delaware between Kahlon and another investor. The testimony was sealed until ProPublica, with the assistance of lawyers at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the law firm Shaw Keller, moved in the spring to make it public. SpaceX fought the effort, but a judge ruled that some of the records must be released. Kahlon’s testimony was publicly filed this week.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"15.0\">Buying shares in SpaceX is much more difficult than buying a piece of a publicly traded company like Tesla or Microsoft. SpaceX has control over who can buy stakes in it, and the company’s investors fall into different categories. The most rarefied group is the direct investors, who actually own SpaceX shares. This group includes funds led by Kahlon, Peter Thiel and a handful of other venture capitalists <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-friends-private-company-access-eb93ba05\">with personal ties to Musk</a>. Then there are the indirect investors, who effectively buy stakes in SpaceX through a middleman like Kahlon. (The indirect investors are actually buying into a fund run by the middleman, typically paying a hefty fee.) All previously known Chinese investors in SpaceX fell into the latter category.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"17.0\">This year, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-spacex-allows-china-investment-cayman-islands-secrecy\">ProPublica reported on</a> an unusual feature of SpaceX’s approach to investment from China. According to testimony from the Delaware case, the company allows Chinese investors to buy stakes in SpaceX so long as the money is routed through the Cayman Islands or other offshore secrecy hubs. Companies only have to proactively report Chinese investments to the government in limited circumstances, and there aren’t hard and fast rules for how much is too much.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"18.0\">After ProPublica’s report, <a href=\"https://democrats-science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/5.6.25%20hasc-sst-minority-joint-letter-to-dod-and-nasa.pdf\">House Democrats sent a letter</a> to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth raising alarms about the company’s “potential obfuscation.” “In light of the extreme sensitivity of SpaceX’s work for DoD and NASA, this lack of transparency raises serious questions,” they wrote. It’s unclear if any action was taken in response.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"19.0\">Kahlon has turned his access to SpaceX stock into a lucrative business. His investor list reads like an atlas of the world. The investors’ names are redacted in the recently unsealed document, but their addresses span from Chile to Malaysia. One is in Russia. At least two are in mainland China. One is in Qatar. (In one email to SpaceX’s chief financial officer, Kahlon said a Los Angeles-based fund had money from the Qatari royal family and was already invested in SpaceX.)</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"20.0\">“You made a big fortune,” a China-based financier wrote to Kahlon four years ago. “Lol something like that. SpaceX has been the gift that keeps on giving,” Kahlon responded. “All thanks to you.”</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"21.0\">Kahlon first met with SpaceX when it was a fledgling startup, according to court records. SpaceX’s CFO, Bret Johnsen, who’s been there for 14 years, testified that Kahlon “has been with the company in one form or fashion longer than I have.” Johnsen also testified that SpaceX has no formal policy about accepting investments from countries deemed adversaries by the U.S. government. But he said he asks fund managers to “stay away from Russian, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean ownership interest” because that could make it “more challenging to win government contracts.”</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"23.0\">There are indications that by 2021, Kahlon was wary of raising funds from China. The U.S. government had grown increasingly concerned about Chinese investments in tech companies, and that June, Kahlon told an associate he was “being picky” with who he’d let buy into a new SpaceX opportunity. “Only people I want to have a relationship with long term. No one from mainland China,” Kahlon said.</p><p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"24.0\">But as he raced to assemble a pool of investors, those concerns appeared to fade away. By November 2021, Kahlon was personally raising money from China to buy SpaceX stakes. He told a Shanghai-based company that if it invested with him, it would get quarterly updates on SpaceX’s business development, “visits to SpaceX, and the opportunities to interview with Space X’s CFO,” court records show.</p><div data-pp-location=\"bottom-note\"><div data-pp-location=\"bottom-note\" data-pp-view=\"\" data-pp-category=\"get involved\"><p>Do you have any information we should know about Elon Musk’s businesses?

If they do it twice, it suggests a habit. But if they do it three times, it’s a communication strategy.</p><p>Keir Starmer said something rather noticeable <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/starmers-speech-merciless-time-reform-feel-afraid-again-3947606?ico=in-line_link\">in his conference speech</a>. He mocked the politicians who’d told voters that “Brexit lies on the side of that bus, click here for your new country”. That made the ears prick up. It’s the first time in a very long time that the Prime Minister has spoken critically about Brexit.</p><p>You know he opposes it. He’s a human rights lawyer from north London. But he is usually too straitjacketed by Labour’s electoral strategy to say so publicly. Perhaps it was an accident, then. A slip of the tongue. Perhaps he let his feelings out by mistake and would keep them better concealed in future. </p><p>Then, moments later, he did it again. The “self-appointed champions of working people”, he said, “lied to this country, unleashed chaos and walked away after Brexit”.</p><p>Oh. So it wasn’t an accident. It was a habit. Then in an interview with GB News – of all people – he went even further. When we were in the EU, Britain had a returns agreement with the European Union on asylum, he pointed out. Farage “told the country it will make no difference if we left – well, he was wrong about that”. The small boats were therefore “Farage Boats”.</p><p>That makes it a communication strategy. You don’t do the same thing three times in 24 hours by accident. And that suggests something profound: that <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/brexit-cheerleaders-have-gone-awfully-quiet-so-let-me-remind-you-what-they-did-to-britain-3512504?ico=in-line_link\">the view of Brexit as a failure is now settled</a>. It has ossified into a national consensus, without us ever really realising it was happening. Even the Labour leadership, which is usually petrified of this issue, believes it can safely criticise it.</p><p>During the <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/cant-argue-brexiters-lost-capacity-for-reason-3704274?ico=in-line_link\">Brexit wars</a>, Remainers would ask themselves when people would realise it was a mistake. The moment stubbornly refused to arrive. The value of sterling collapsed. The EU comprehensively out-negotiated us. Our political system fell into chaos. Small businesses went bust. None of it seemed to move the dial.</p><p>The truth is, people are terrible at owning up to their mistakes. They very rarely admit that they were wrong about something. Instead, they turn into mini-Stalins, expunging their historical record and replacing it with one in which they were always right. People have very poor memories, especially when it comes to their own errors.</p><p>Take the Iraq War. Nowadays, everyone seems to have been against it. They always knew it would be a disaster. They’d always thought so.</p><p>But this is not how it felt at the time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/mar/17/mondaymediasection.Iraqandthemedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Back then</a>, there was broad and animated support for the war. , , , ,  and all supported it. With a combined circulation of 9.4 million, they massively outweighed the three papers opposing the war – the , and  – which had a combined audience of 2.7 million.</p><p>YouGov conducted <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/45444-iraq-war-20-years-later-what-do-britons-think-abou\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">21 polls</a> between March and December 2003, asking whether people supported the war. On average, 54 per cent of Brits thought it was right. Now, that figure has plummeted, with just 23 per cent of people thinking it was right.</p><p>Fine, so people changed their minds. Well, not quite. That would have involved a degree of honest introspection most people are incapable of. Instead, they simply rearranged the past so that it reflected their newfound view.</p><p>When YouGov <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/12483-remembering-iraq\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">asked people in 2015</a> what their opinions of war in Iraq were at the time, just 37 per cent said they supported military action, an astonishing drop from the figures at the time. The effect is even more dramatic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/12386-americans-remember-opposing-2003-war-iraq\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in the US</a>. At the time of the war, 63 per cent of people backed the invasion. But a few years later, just 38 per cent recalled doing so.</p><p>Slowly but surely, the same thing seems to be happening with Brexit. There was no one central event, no great moment of epiphany in which the nation realised what an error the whole thing was. But slowly, like rising damp, a sense of disdain, mockery and disappointment has taken over. A settled view has developed, without drama or surprise, without anyone even really noticing that it’s happening.</p><p>Who on earth could claim that Brexit has been a success? Who could name a single benefit it has provided? Who could look at the promises made before the referendum and treat them with anything but bitter laughter now we know how it turned out?</p><p>People will find different ways of framing their box-fresh opposition. They’ll say politicians missed the opportunities, or we had bad leadership, or the EU sabotaged us. But the truth is, it was a failure because it was a bad idea. It’s no more complicated than that. Voters were convinced to support a project to give the political class a kicking. In fact, they simply damaged themselves and their livelihoods.</p><p>None of that really matters anymore. What matters is that an anti-Brexit consensus helps us repair the damage.</p><p>Labour is not about to commit to rejoining the EU. Of course not. But it is pursuing a plan for a really quite intimate relationship with it: regulatory alignment in many areas, deep co-operation on defence, and now the Chancellor is confidently promoting an extensive youth mobility scheme – something which the party was reticent about supporting just a few months ago.</p><p>That’ll do for now. But as the consensus grows and Labour becomes more confident in criticising Brexit, the possibilities grow for the kinds of things we can demand in a few years’ time, perhaps in time for the next election. Single market membership, perhaps, or the customs union, or a bespoke arrangement like Switzerland has. Or perhaps even full-blown membership.</p><p>Brexit was always a terrible mistake. But now, at least, people recognise it. And with that, things might just start to improve.</p>","contentLength":5715,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nvzak1/brexit_was_a_disaster_now_uk_pm_starmer_dares_to/"},{"title":"Dutch F-35 shoots down Russian drone, displays kill marking","url":"https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/dutch-f-35-shoots-down-russian-drone-displays-kill-marking/","date":1759394227,"author":"/u/MGC91","guid":670,"unread":true,"content":"<h4>A Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) F-35A has received a drone kill marking after shooting down a Russian drone during the September 9–10 incursion into Polish airspace.</h4><p>The incident, which saw around 23 drones cross from Belarus into Poland, triggered a NATO-wide Quick Reaction Alert and was described by Polish leaders as an “unprecedented case of an attack” on NATO territory.</p><p>The engagement was carried out by an F-35A of the 313th Squadron, deployed to Poland as part of NATO’s enhanced air policing mission. The Dutch Ministry of Defence later released an image showing a white drone silhouette painted below the canopy rail of the aircraft, marking the first confirmed combat kill for a Dutch Lightning II.</p><p>According to Polish officials, the drones entered Poland around 23:30 local time on 9 September, forcing the closure of Warsaw International, Warsaw Modlin, Rzeszów–Jasionka and Lublin airports. At least four drones were shot down, most by Dutch fighters. Analysts later identified several of the drones as Gerbera-type decoys, apparently designed to test allied defences and disrupt civil aviation.</p><p>Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans, who visited the Dutch F-35 detachment in Poland days after the incident, praised the professionalism and teamwork involved. “Russia’s reckless aggression continues,” he said. “By stationing F-35s in Poland, the Netherlands is demonstrating its readiness with allies, because NATO’s eastern border is also our security border.” He highlighted not only the role of the pilots, but also the mechanics and ground crews, who ensured the jets were combat-ready.</p><p>The deployment of Dutch F-35s to Poland began on 1 September and will run until December, with the aircraft tasked to protect NATO airspace and deter further Russian incursions. From December, the Netherlands will also reinforce the mission with Patriot surface-to-air missiles, NASAMS, and counter-drone systems, bolstering Poland’s role as a logistics hub for support to Ukraine.</p><p>The September drone incursion marked one of the largest airspace violations by Russia since the start of its invasion of Ukraine. Poland invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty in response, warning allies that Russian and Belarusian military activity represented an escalating threat. In the days after the incident, Russia and Belarus staged large-scale joint exercises, while NATO launched Operation Eastern Sentry to strengthen its air defences across the eastern flank.</p><p>For the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the kill marking underscores both the combat credibility of the F-35 and the country’s willingness to take an active role in Europe’s collective defence. The F-35A, with its advanced sensor fusion and stealth, is optimised for detecting and engaging drones that might evade older radar systems. Dutch officials stressed that its deployment has already proven vital in securing NATO’s skies against Russian provocations.</p>","contentLength":2941,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nvyb30/dutch_f35_shoots_down_russian_drone_displays_kill/"},{"title":"Belgian Prime Minister De Wever: \"I am willing to use the frozen Russian assets (€185b frozen in Belgium), but I need legal certainty and solidarity from other EU Member States to share the risks involved\".","url":"https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/liveblog/premier-de-wever-over-bevroren-russisch-geld-we-zijn-bereid-om~1758694365422/","date":1759393592,"author":"/u/BelgianPolitics","guid":668,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\"Het was een heel zware nacht in Kiev\", zegt Vlaming Barend Leyts, in het verleden nog journalist en woordvoerder van premier De Croo, die momenteel in de Oekraïense hoofdstad is als vrijwilliger voor een hulporganisatie.
