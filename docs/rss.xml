The RSS was founded in 1925, with the explicit aim of establishing a Hindu nation in the wake of British colonial rule. It has deep ties with the ruling BJP party, and Prime Mine Minister Narendra Modi was a former member. Despite being banned several times, it has enjoyed a recent surge in political power, which critics see as a threat to the country's secular society.

After Linus Torvalds yesterday shot down RISC-V big endian prospects for the Linux kernel, today he has used his authority to wage a war on "crazy" Rust code formatting as well as to critique poor text formatting.
In response to the recently submitted Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem pull request, Torvalds began by voicing his displeasure over the text formatting of it:
"Notice how there are multiple sub-areas: Alloc, DMA/Scatterlist, DRM and Rust.
But it's all just a random jumble, because you have apparently pasted it into your editor or MUA or whatever and dropped the indentation in the process.
What kind of *broken* editor are you using? I'm not trying to start an emacs or vi war here, but you seem to be using something truly broken.
...
Look, again, no logic and you've completely corrupted any multi-level indentation that presumably existed at some point judging by the organization.
...
Please make the explanations *readable*, not just a random jumble of words."Edlin is the line/text editor found on early versions of PC DOS and MS-DOS...
But then on a more technical note, Linus Torvalds went on to seek better clarity of Rust code formatting moving forward. When looking at the Rust DRM code added for Linux 6.18, Torvalds commented after looking at some of the new code:
"And on a more technical side: I absolutely detest the mindless and completely crazy Rust format checking.
I noticed that people added multiple
next to each other, so I turned them into
     xyz,
  };
instead to make it easy to just add another crate without messing crap up. The use statements around it had that format too, so it all seemed sensible and visually consistent.
But then I run rustfmtcheck, and that thing is all bass-ackwards garbage. Instead of making it clean and clear to add new rules, it suggests
but I have no idea what the heuristics for when to use multiple lines and when to use that compressed format are.
This is just ANNOYING. It's automated tooling that is literally making bad decisions for the maintainability. This is the kind of thing that makes future conflicts harder for me to deal with.
Miguel, I know you asked me to run rustfmtcheck, but that thing is just WRONG. It may be right "in the moment", but it is
 (a) really annoying when merging and not knowing what the heck the rules are
 (b) it's bad long term when you don't have clean lists of "add one line for a new use"
Is there some *sane* solution to this? Because I left my resolution alone and ignored the horrible rustfmtcheck results.
I tried to google the rust format rules, and apparently it's this:
    https://doc.rust-lang.org/style-guide/index.html#small-items
can we please fix up whatever random heuristics? That small items thing may make sense when we're talking things that really are one common data structure, but the "use" directive is literally about *independent* things that get used, and smushing them all together seems entirely wrong.
I realize that a number of users seem to just leave the repeated
   use kernel::abc;
as separate lines, possibly *becasue* of this horrendous rustfmt random heuristic behavior."The post in full can be read on the LKML.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Synagogue attack in Britain; OpenAI’s $500bn valuation, and more</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/theeconomistmorningbriefing/episodes/synagogue-attack-in-britain-openais-500bn-valuation</link><author></author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/theeconomistmorningbriefing/e/68df4445bd7f04b74f4f78f6/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJpbiI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3NTk0NjI0MTE4NjAtY2VjMWVkMTAtZjU0Ny00NTliLTk1M2UtN2M4NzBjMzczYTZmLXB1YmxpY0ludHJvLm1wMyIsIm91dCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3NTk0NjI0MTU0MTktZWJmMDM5ZTItZGViMi00ZTI4LThhNzYtNWE3OTdlMzUyNGE5LXB1YmxpY091dHJvLm1wMyIsInN0YXR1cyI6InB1YmxpYyJ9&amp;sig=3WEU0CCfoAgOUfo1ibkWjw4HiHsgXZ08hTT_jKeVM-c" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 3 Oct 2025 03:34:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-world-in-brief">News - Daily Brief</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cops: Accused Vandal Confessed To ChatGPT</title><link>https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/10/02/238239/cops-accused-vandal-confessed-to-chatgpt?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 3 Oct 2025 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[alternative_right shares a report from the Smoking Gun: Minutes after vandalizing 17 cars in a Missouri college parking lot, a 19-year-old sophomore had a lengthy ChatGPT conversation during which he confessed to the crime, asked about the possibility of getting caught, and wondered, "is there any way they could know it was me," according to a police probable cause statement. Ryan Schaefer was arrested yesterday and charged with felony property damage for a rampage early Sunday at a Missouri State University parking lot. Investigators allege that Schaefer shattered car windows, ripped off side mirrors, dented hoods, and broke windshield wipers during the 3 AM spree.
 
When confronted with surveillance footage and other evidence, Schaefer said that he could see the resemblance between the suspect and himself. At that point, Schaefer reportedly consented to a search of his iPhone. A subsequent review of the device revealed location data placing Schaefer "at or near the scene of the crime," as well as a "troubling dialogue exchange this defendant seems to have had with artificial intelligence software installed on his phone," prosecutors reported.

In September, Denmark was forced to close several airports after what it called a "coordinated attack" by drones. The big question is: who is responsible? 

Now French forces have seized a tanker suspected of being part of Russia's shadow fleet used to illegally transport Russian oil, and maritime tracking data shows that the tanker was off the coast of Denmark at the time of the drone flights. French authorities have not yet said whether the ship is suspected of being involved in the drone incursions. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has blamed Russia for the spike in drone activity and is calling on European countries to take action.

So, there's more than one condition out there that's being diagnosed as "autism." This, of course, messes with the debate about causes; one version of autism may be caused by something for which the evidence is very weak overall. "The term 'autism' likely describes multiple conditions," said Dr Varun Warrier, from Cambridge's department of psychiatry, senior author of the research. "For the first time, we have found that earlier and later diagnosed autism have different underlying biological and developmental profiles."
 
"It is a gradient," added Warrier. "There are also many other factors that contribute to age of diagnosis, so the moment you go from averages to anything that is applicable to an individual, it's false equivalency."
 
The analysis has been published in the journal Nature.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Americans react to government shutdown</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OSdFXMJrfYo</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OSdFXMJrfYo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 3 Oct 2025 01:59:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How are Americans reacting to to the first government shutdown in nearly seven years?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ford IT Systems Tampered With To Display Vulgar Anti-RTO Message Across Office Screens</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/10/02/224238/ford-it-systems-tampered-with-to-display-vulgar-anti-rto-message-across-office-screens?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 3 Oct 2025 01:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ford's push for a four-day in-office workweek hit turbulence when someone hijacked meeting room screens to display an anti-RTO protest image targeting CEO Jim Farley. The company quickly removed it and is investigating. The Detroit Free Press reports: According to photos employees took of the image, which were posted on social media and sent to the Detroit Free Press, it contained an image of CEO Jim Farley along with a big red circle with a slash through it over his face and the words "(Expletive) RTO."
 
"We're aware of an inappropriate use of Ford's IT technology and we're investigating it," Dave Tovar, Ford spokesman, told the Detroit Free Press. Tovar said the image was up for "a short amount of time" and Ford was able to quickly remove it. He said the company is investigating whether the image appeared only in Dearborn offices or globally.
 
Farley mandated that employees return to the office four days a week earlier this year and it has been in place since Sept. 1, with no fallout such as people quitting over it, Tovar said. Therefore, Tovar said, "I wouldn't be able to speculate on it, as to why someone would do this."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Global Sumud Flotilla LIVE: Boat sails toward Gaza carrying aid</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnXPg1oeWKc</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/pnXPg1oeWKc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 3 Oct 2025 01:23:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as the final boat in the flotilla continues sailing toward Gaza.

			Honestly, I think Apple really needs to simplify the iPhone for the elderly. I know there are accessibility modes, but you don’t want to have to go through all that and spend hours trying to customize the phone. Also, the whole phone setup process needs to be delayed; having to go through it for an hour puts them off from even wanting to bother. I first set the phones up to make accounts, but it turns out none of them could understand how to unlock the phone. Entering a passcode was a nightmare because they kept forgetting it, even though it was a birthday they knew, lol.
So, I tried Touch ID and Face ID, and that was even more complicated and kept erroring out. Then, the Siri thing kept popping up on the phones with Touch ID, despite turning it off, and the whole swiping from the button kept making the screen go down to the bottom half. :/ There were too many apps; all they wanted was the phone app, but it doesn’t default to the keypad, which was too much for them to find.
The phones are too fiddly now, and pressing random things as they try to hold the phone meant the phone got lost in a sea of opening stuff up. So, I tried the assistive access, but why isn’t this an option from the get-go? It asks you the age of setup; why not have a 65+ or something for a senior mode?
They don’t need passcodes, accounts, and a sea of information. It’s insane, and it’s insane how fiddly these phones are. I never noticed because I’m used to it, but for these people with hands that barely move, the fake Touch ID button and the swiping from the bottom on Face ID phones seem to be the worst! I think having a proper physical button, like iPhones used to have, would have been superior. The one complaint about the fake button was that it didn’t feel like a real button, so they couldn’t gauge it.
I left there achieving nothing because they couldn’t figure out their old Nokia phones. The unlock thing on the keypad was too difficult, and if I turned that off, they kept dialing 999 in their pockets for some reason. That’s why I was there: they were calling emergency services 100 times a day, lol.
I think what I’ve realized is that I need to go back with flip phones that answer and hang up when you open and close them. However, the two I tried before didn’t act like that, and they had too many features. I really thought I could make the iPhone simple, but NOPE!
Apple should work on their phones to make them more accessible and less fiddly, without having to go through a sea of menus.

The Washington Post says the new proposed measures are outlined in internal documents. The Pentagon's chief spokesperson has called the Post's report 'untrue and irresponsible'.

            Munich Airport in Germany was forced to close for almost seven hours overnight after a wave of drone sightings, the latest European aviation hub to shutter over unexplained drone flights.
    
            A total of 17 flights were grounded shortly after 10 p.m. local time on Thursday, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers, the airport said in a statement.
    
            In addition, 15 arriving flights were diverted to the German cities of Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Frankfurt, as well as Vienna in neighboring Austria, the statement said. Flight tracking website Flightradar showed several planes circling the airport at around 11pm local time before heading to other destinations.
    
            The airport reopened at 5 a.m local time when flight arrivals and departures were deemed safe, a call handler fielding passenger enquiries told CNN.
    
            “Now everything has resumed. Some flights were cancelled but the airport has reopened. Since 5 a.m, all arrivals and departures are safe,” they said.
    
            The first plane scheduled to land in Munich was a Lufthansa long haul flight from Bangkok, estimated to touch down at 5.25 a.m, according to the airport’s website.
    
            The airport in Bavaria, southern Germany, is a hub for German flag-carrier Lufthansa, and served nearly 20 million passengers in the first half of this year.
    
            A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN that 19 of its flights were cancelled or diverted due to the closure, including three long-haul flights to Asia which are set to be rescheduled.
    
            It had provided the affected passengers with food, drink and blankets, they said. Agency photos showed people sleeping on a row of camp beds.
    
            CNN has reached out to the Bavarian state police, Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office, and Germany’s domestic intelligence agency for comment.
    
            Munich becomes the latest European airport to close after sightings of drones nearby. A spate of sightings over several airports in Denmark last week saw tens of thousands of passengers impacted.
    
            Denmark later banned all civil drone flights in its airspace as it prepared to host a summit of European leaders in Copenhagen this week to discuss support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, and bolstering European security.
    
            At the summit leaders were expected to discuss several measures intended to protect the continent’s skies, including a flagship “drone wall” initiative.
    
            The drone wall initiative would not be a physical wall, but instead a layered network of detection and interception systems, building on individual EU members’ anti-drone capabilities.
    
            Europe has been on high alert in recent weeks due to a string of drone sightings, as well as alleged incursions by Russian drones into NATO airspace over Poland and Romania, and the alleged violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets.
    
            Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that while authorities cannot conclude who was behind the drone sightings in Denmark, “we can at least conclude that there is primarily one country that poses a threat to Europe’s security – and that is Russia.”
    
            The Kremlin has denied involvement in the drone sightings, as well as that it violated Estonian airspace.
    
            During a lengthy four hour televised event on Thursday, which touched on multiple key sticking points with Europe and the US, Putin scoffed at Western claims of possible Russian involvement in recent drone flights over Denmark, casting them as part of purported NATO efforts to “inflame tensions to boost the defense spending.”
    
            “I won’t anymore. Not to France, not to Denmark, not to Copenhagen,” he joked, in reference to the drone flight allegations.
    
            But he also issued a veiled threat.
    
            “We are carefully watching the growing militarization of Europe,” he said. “Is all of this just words or is it time for us to take countermeasures? No one should have doubt that Russia’s countermeasures will not take a long time to come.”
    
            Munich, a historic city of more than 1 million people, was already on edge after its famed Oktoberfest beer festival was closed for several hours earlier this week due to a bomb threat.

The Denver Gazette reports: At a press event in Falcon on Monday, the Colorado Department of Transportation demonstrated an autonomous truck-mounted attenuator -- a driverless crash-protection vehicle designed to absorb impacts in roadside work areas. These trucks are already in the state's fleet, but previously required a worker in the cab, leaving them exposed during crashes. "These vehicles are designed to get hit so people don't have to," said Kay Kelly, CDOT's chief of innovative mobility. "We want to remove the human from that truck whenever possible."
 
[...] Colorado pioneered this technology in 2017, becoming the first state to test it. Developed by San Diego-based defense contractor Kratos Defense, the company started on autonomous follower systems in 2012 and installed its initial version in Colorado in 2013, according to Maynard Factor, Kratos' vice president of business development. The system uses sensors, actuators, and video links, allowing the unmanned crash truck to trail directly behind a paint-striping or maintenance vehicle. The lead vehicle records its route and transmits navigation data to the follower. Both are equipped with global positioning system and communication tools, with the lead driver monitoring via video feed.
 
"It's a convoy system," Factor said. "The leader does the work, while the driverless vehicle mirrors its path. This protects the operator with the crash truck instead of sitting inside it." Sensors detect objects darting into the lane, triggering an automatic stop. Operators can pause or override via a user interface featuring forward-facing cameras on the autonomous truck and rear-facing ones on the work vehicle. The trucks, existing state assets, are driven to sites and then switched to autonomous mode. Outfitting each with the technology costs about $1 million, excluding the base vehicle and crash absorber.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Shutdown Risks Higher Health Care for Millions | Balance of Power 10/02/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOz1arA0W5E</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hOz1arA0W5E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 3 Oct 2025 00:33:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Balance of Power: Late Edition" focuses on the intersection of politics and global business.

The Institute (ITP) wrote to members on Thursday and posted a document titled "Important Update on ITP's Future" that reveals it has "reached a point where the organization cannot continue. After a full review of our finances, the Board has confirmed that ITP is insolvent."
 
Insolvency seems to have come as something of a surprise. "These debts are historic. They go back over many years. While some of the issues were worked on in more recent times, the full scale of the problem only became visible during the leadership change in 2025," the Update states. "Once the Board understood the full picture, it was clear that there was no responsible way forward other than liquidation." [...]
 
ITP's constitution requires its members to formally resolve to wind up the organization, so as one of its final acts the group has called a Special General Meeting (SGM) for 23 October 2025 to confirm liquidation and appoint a liquidator. This situation impacts more than ITP's ~10,000 members, because the organization offers assessment services that assess whether IT professionals' skills and qualifications make them eligible to move to New Zealand for work. ITP also certifies IT degrees at New Zealand universities, and oversees the NZ Cloud Computing Code of Practice. ITP also conducted educational and advocacy activities aimed at growing New Zealand's tech workforce.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What are investors watching in Cameroon&apos;s election? | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR8h_t5ybLQ</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kR8h_t5ybLQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 3 Oct 2025 00:01:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cameroon's voters will decide on October 12 whether to grant 92-year-old President Paul Biya an extension of his four-decade rule.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the United States that supplies of long-range missiles to Ukraine will seriously damage relations between Moscow and Washington but will not change the situation on the battlefield, where the Russian army is making slow but steady advances.
    
            The potential supply of US Tomahawk cruise missiles to Kyiv will signal a “qualitatively new stage of escalation, including in relations between Russia and the US,” Putin said at a forum of international foreign policy experts in Russia’s Black Sea resort of Sochi.
    
            The Russian leader noted that even though Tomahawk missiles will inflict damage on Russia if supplied to Ukraine, Russian air defenses will quickly adapt to the new threat. “It will certainly not change the balance of force on the battlefield,” he added, emphasizing that the Russian military is continuously making gains against Ukraine.
    
            Asked about Trump dismissing Russia as a “paper tiger” because of its failure to defeat its smaller neighbor after more than 3 1/2 years of fighting, Putin argued that Russia has faced all the NATO allies backing Kyiv.
    
            “We are fighting against the entire bloc of NATO and we keep moving, keep advancing and feel confident and we are a paper tiger; what NATO itself is?” he said. “A paper tiger? Go and deal with this paper tiger then.”
    
            The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Putin’s remarks.
    
            At the same time, Putin hailed US President Donald Trump’s efforts to help negotiate peace in Ukraine and described their August summit in Alaska as productive.
    
            “It was good that we made an attempt to search for and find possible ways to settle the Ukrainian crisis,” he said, adding that he felt “comfortable” talking to Trump.
    
            Putin also reaffirmed his offer to the US to extend their last remaining nuclear arms control pact for one more year after it expires in February. The 2010 New START treaty limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.
    
            “If they don’t need it, we don’t need it either,” he said, adding that “we feel confident about our nuclear shield.”
    
            While praising Trump and trying to emphasize potential common interests, the Russian president sent a stern warning to Ukraine’s Western allies against trying to seize ships that carry Russian oil to global markers. He argued that would amount to piracy and could trigger a forceful response while sharply destabilizing the global oil market.
    
            Threatening a forceful response to Western “piracy,” mocking drone claims
    
            Asked about the detention of an oil tanker off France’s Atlantic coast, which President Emmanuel Macron linked to Russia’s so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers of uncertain ownership that are avoiding Western sanctions, Putin cast it as an attempt by Macron to distract public attention from his country’s own internal problems and mockingly likened the French leader to Napoleon.
    
            He strongly warned the West against such action, arguing that it defies international maritime law and risks triggering military confrontation. “It’s piracy, and how do you deal with pirates? You destroy them,” he said.
    
            Putin also scoffed at Western claims of possible Russian involvement in recent drone flights over Denmark, casting them as part of purported NATO efforts to “inflame tensions to boost the defense spending.”
    
            Intrusions into NATO’s airspace blamed on Russia reached an unprecedented scale last month. A swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland, Estonia complained about an intrusion by Russian fighter jets and numerous unidentified drones were sighted over Denmark, Germany and other countries in what some European officials described as Moscow testing NATO’s response.
    
            European defense ministers have agreed to develop a “drone wall” along their borders to better detect, track and intercept drones violating Europe’s airspace.
    
            Putin dismissed Western allegations of Russia’s purported aggressive plans against NATO allies as “nonsense” aimed at distracting public attention from domestic problems.
    
            “We are carefully watching the growing militarization of Europe,” he said. “Is all of this just words or is it time for us to take countermeasures? No one should have doubt that Russia’s countermeasures will not take a long time to come.”
    
            Asked about Charlie Kirk’s assassination, Putin called it a “heinous crime” that reflected a “deep split” in American society. He hailed Kirk as a hero killed for promoting the same conservative values that Russia shares.
    
            Putin also praised Michael Gloss, an American and the son of a deputy CIA chief, who joined the Russian military and was killed in action in Ukraine in 2024. He said he had awarded Gloss with a medal, which he handed to Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff during his visit to Moscow.
    
            The Russian leader likened Gloss to Kirk, saying they championed similar “traditional” values. “He gave his life while defending those values as a Russian soldier, and Kirk gave his life while fighting for the same values in the United States,” Putin said.
    
            In response to questions about Gloss, the CIA said in a statement that the agency “considers Michael’s passing to be a private family matter — and not a national security issue. The entire CIA family is heartbroken for their loss.”
    
            At one point during the four-hour event televised live, Putin, a former Soviet KGB officer and one-time head of Russia’s top domestic security agency, misspoke and referred to himself as “the CIA director” while describing a meeting with President George W. Bush and his administration officials.
    
             “The future director,” Putin quipped as the audience broke into laughter.

"Discussions are underway between the two companies to move an undisclosed amount of AMD's chip business to Intel foundries. (AMD currently does their production through TSMC.) The talks come hot on the heels of a flurry of other Intel investments." Tom's Hardware reports: In the past several weeks, Intel has seen a flurry of activity and investments. The United States announced a 9.9% ownership stake in Intel, while Softbank bought $2 billion worth of shares. Alongside Nvidia, Intel announced new x86 chips using Nvidia graphics technology, with the graphics giant also purchasing $5 billion in Intel shares. There have also been reports that Intel and Apple have been exploring ways to work together. The article notes that there is a trade/political dimension to an AMD-Intel deal as well: It makes sense for Intel's former rivals -- especially American companies -- to consider coming to the table. The White House is pushing for 50% of chips bound for America to be built domestically, and tariffs on chips aren't off the table. Additionally, doing business with Intel could make the US government, Intel's largest shareholder, happy, which can be good for business. AMD faced export restrictions on its GPUs earlier this year as the US attempted to throttle China's AI business.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What really happened in the storm clouds over Dubai?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Bz-J27986fw</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Bz-J27986fw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 23:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dubai's deadly floods caused $3 billion of damage.

Amazon confirmed the incident and is working with authorities to determine what happened, though no injuries have been reported. CNBC reports: The incident occurred on Wednesday around 1 p.m. EST in Tolleson, Arizona, a city west of Phoenix. Two MK30 drones crashed into the boom of a stationary construction crane that was in a commercial area just a few miles away from an Amazon warehouse. One person was evaluated on the scene for possible smoke inhalation, said Sergeant Erik Mendez of the Tolleson Police Department.
 
Both drones sustained "substantial" damage from the collision on Wednesday, which occurred when the aircraft were mid-route, according to preliminary FAA crash reports.

Alejo "Shishi" Warles, the 25-year-old operator of Al Angulo TV, was arrested on August 20 in a LaLiga-backed crackdown. After his release on bail, he was hired by professional esports team 9z Globant, a partnership involving Argentine tech unicorn Globant. [...] The team is the result of a partnership between 9z Team and Argentinian tech unicorn Globant. Somewhat ironically, Globant previously worked with LaLiga to monitor the live-streaming user experience. Warles welcomed himself to 9z Globant via the team's social media account, referring to himself as an idol, genius, and GOAT.
 
Lucia Quinteros, the main social media manager at the esports team, informed Entre Rios that after considering their new hire's history, they believe that he can add value to the team. "We hired Alejo, not the person who set up that project (Al Angulo TV). Of course, we evaluated what happened, but we believe that, from now on, Alejo can pursue a different career path," Quinteros said. According to Warles himself, he was hired because he's the best. Like many of his comments, this bravado should not be taken too seriously, but nevertheless sits in stark contrast to the typical pirate site operator facing criminal charges.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Privacy for Subdomains: Here&apos;s What You Should Be Focusing On</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/privacy-for-subdomains-heres-what-you-should-be-focusing-on?source=rss</link><author>Nicolas Fränkel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 21:58:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, I described a gloomy situation: all public TLS certificate providers log your requests. By browsing through the subdomains, one can get their respective IP addresses. If one of them points to your home route, they know your general location.\
I analyzed several solutions and decided to use wildcard certificates, which don't leak subdomain information, while continuing to use Let's Encrypt. My solution caters to my Synology NAS, as it's the one I'm using.Getting a Wildcard Certificate for Synology NASThe Synology UI allows configuring Let's Encrypt for automated certificate renewal. But you can get wildcard certificates only for Synology subdomains:Only domains of Synology DDNS support wildcard certificates issued by Let's Encrypt.\
It's time to become creative. The most widespread Let's Encrypt client is Certbot, but a surface search reveals it doesn't run on Synology. Underneath, Let's Encrypt delivers certificates via the Automatic Certificate Management Environment protocol. Lots of clients already implement the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol. acme.sh looked like an interesting candidate:An ACME protocol client written purely in Shell (Unix shell) language.Full ACME protocol implementation.Support SAN and wildcard certsSimple, powerful and very easy to use. You only need 3 minutes to learn it.Bash, dash and sh compatible.Purely written in Shell with no dependencies on python.Just one script to issue, renew and install your certificates automatically.DOES NOT require  access.Cron job notifications for renewal or error etc.\
Icing on the cake, acme.sh provides a Docker image. At the same time, Synology offers a Docker runtime. I thus decided to implement certificate renewal with the acme.sh Docker image. Here's how I proceeded.\
Go to the  menu. In the opening window, click on , then . It opens a Create Container window. Click on  and search for .\
We will need to create two containers out of it: one for requesting a new certificate, and one for managing the update of the certificate on the NAS.Before we go further, we need:To get a token with permissions to edit the DNS records:In my case, it's Cloudflare. You can check the process for other providers on the acme.sh wiki.\
Go to the Cloudflare UI. Create an API token with the template to . Set a relevant name. Then, set the Zone Resources to the following:| Include | Specific zone |  |\
Write down the token value in a secure place, as you won't be able to access it later!Prepare an account for the Synology:For security purposes, we want to run the containers with a dedicated account.\
Check the section Create a user in Synology DSM in this post and follow its instructions. It's what I did, and it worked exactly as described.Requesting the CertificateGo back to the Synology UI, more specifically, the  menu. Click on the  button. It opens a wizard with several screens:When you run the container, it will create the required files in the  folder.ls -ltr /volume2/homes/certadmin

\
If it doesn't work, you can access the logs by selecting the image and clicking on the  button. The log tab shows the logs, broken up by day. Here's a log sample of a successful run:[Sat Jul  5 12:30:17 UTC 2025] Verification finished, beginning signing."

[Sat Jul  5 12:30:20 UTC 2025] And the full-chain cert is in: /acme.sh/*.frankel.ch_ecc/fullchain.cer
Deploying the CertificateWe will use the same image to deploy the certificate, albeit with a different configuration.The image uses the files created by the previous image to update the TLS certificate used by the Synology web app.Scheduling the Run of the ImagesIn an ideal world, you'd run the first image, and a successful run would trigger the run of the second image. Unfortunately, Synology doesn't lend itself to this, or to be precise, I didn't find a way to achieve it. Instead, I relied on a simple workaround: schedule the second image run one day after the first image run.\
In the Synology UI, open the Control Panel and search for the Task Scheduler. Click on the  button. Select Scheduled Task > User-defined script, as there's no dedicated Docker run item.\
Here's how to configure it:The script uses the  command. I stumbled upon the command; parameters are self-explanatory, but I didn't find the documentation. You need to create two scheduled tasks and change the task name as well as the image name in the command.\
For scheduling, space out one day between getting a new certificate and deploying it. That should give enough time and doesn't change the result.\
Note that because images run to completion, , they don't loop, Synology will send a warning notification similar to the following, regardless of whether the run was successful or not:Docker container neilpang-acme-deploy-cert stopped unexpectedly. Go to Docker for more information.\
After running the two Docker images in turn, your NAS will be using a joker certificate.In this post, we implemented a solution to avoid leaking subdomain information when requesting a TLS certificate: requesting wildcard certificates with acme.sh from Synology. The solution isn't perfect: you can use wildcard certificates on any subdomains, but it represents a security risk if someone steals them. \
Besides, I stored the secrets as environment variables for configuring Docker images. However, in my context, these are acceptable risks.\
Note that this approach doesn't remove any previously logged requests. The only workaround is to move to another place, or, barring that, change your Internet Service Provider.Originally published at A Java Geek on September 28th, 2025]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Breaking down Napheesa Collier&apos;s critique of the WNBA</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/05_q15vJVX8</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/05_q15vJVX8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 21:55:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Napheesa Collier delivered a blistering assessment of the WNBA and its commissioner on Tuesday as she sat in front of the media with a prepared statement, disclosing private conversations she said she had with Cathy Engelbert that portrayed her as a leader who lacks accountability.

Attempts to deploy such frameworks to the edge, such as Akamai [4], do not deliver the security guarantee required by the Edge Computing. S-FaaS [5], Clemmys [42] uses TEE and cryptographic attestation to protect the confidentiality of the execution. For all the aforementioned FaaS frameworks, they do not support stateful FaaS execution [38].\
Secure Execution with TEE: PSL is motivated by the vision that the distributive worker can run securely in a TEE on a single host, making the security and efficiency of communication among multiple enclaves a logical research problem. This vision is supported by a variety of available container services and platforms, for example, TEE-enabled container services such as GrapheneSGX [43], Scone [7], and Occlum [34] and hardware TEE platforms [27] , Elasticlave [46] and Penglai [16]. Snort [26] is an in-enclave intrusion detection framework that also uses a circular buffer for communication. We note our approach differs from Snort in that they use circular buffers to convert hugepages in DPDK, while our circular buffer design is to eliminate the context switch in ecalls/ocalls.\
: Existing TEE-based KVS designs mainly focus on single-TEE persistence and performance optimizations. ShieldStore [25] solves the 128MB limitation of SGXv1 by conducting most processing outside the enclave. Each key-value pair is encrypted and protected with a signature when it leaves the enclave, and the main data structures of the KVS are also stored outside the enclave. The in-enclave KVS server handles queries from an out-of-enclave client by fetching encrypted key-value pairs from untrusted memory. Speicher [9] and DiskShield [3] implement secure storage inside a secure enclave, so that the TEE can exchange data securely to the underlying storage of the host. Both SCL and Speicher [9] use a LSM-based structure for durablity, but SCL takes a step further to integrate the stored data blocks as part of the DataCapsule hash chain, and to enable efficient interenclave communication. SCL also has a much smaller TCB required than Speicher. EnclaveCache [10] and Omega [14] supports shared, in-memory KVS cache but does not support communication of enclaves from different hosts.We introduced Paranoid Stateful Lambdas, a federated FaaS framework for secure and stateful execution in both cloud and edge computing environments. We focus on the security and communication aspects of PSL by exploiting the properties and extensions of DataCaspules, a cryptographically-hardened blockchain. We propose an abstraction, the Secure Concurrency Layer, that provides security and eventual consistency to the enclaves, as well as discuss its durability and fault tolerance semantics. On our end-to-end benchmark, SCL has up to 81x higher throughput and 2.08x lower latency than the unoptimized baseline. Our system throughput scales linearly with the number of the lambdas, and our lambda task can be dispatched to authenticated workers within 0.61 second.We thank Anoop Jaishankar for great discussion on Asylo attestation.

And it’s not a good one. English spelling is so complex that we’ve made mastering it into a competitive sport: what would be the point of a spelling bee in a language with a predictable spelling system? Where’s the fun unless you have to sweat a little as you struggle to recall whether this particular word is one where “‘i’ before ‘e’ except after ‘c’” doesn’t apply?In short, English has a complicated writing system.the Frenchstingy printerslate medieval yuppiesBut like an Icelandic family saga, we begin not with the story of yogh, but with the story of its parent. So allow me to introduce you to the letter ‘g,’ which, as you’ll soon see, is a complicated letter in its own right, dating back to Old English.It starts with the shape of the letter. When modern editors print Old English today, they print nice, modern-looking ‘g’s — that is, the ones we use today, with an open or closed loop on the bottom, depending on the typeface.‘How we have heard of the glory of the kings of the spear-Danes in days of old’ But in the manuscript, they’re written like this:London, British Library, Cotton MS Vitellius A XV, f. 132r.Now, there’s clearly lots of other weird stuff going on in the manuscript, but focus on how the ‘g’ is represented. While the majuscule (capital) ‘G’ in ‘gardena’ is spelled more like a modern ‘g,’ all the others are insular ‘ᵹ.’So for a period, both ‘g’ and ‘ᵹ’ were used in England, but generally speaking, each was used for writing the ‘g’ sound in a different language. Simple enough, but the stage was set for things to get a lot more complicated. But for that, we need the help of the Normans.The Dead Language Societyupgrade to support my mission of bringing historical linguistics out of the ivory towertwo extra Saturday deep-divesBeowulf Book Clubpart 1part 2Norman scribesThese Norman scribes inherited the writing traditions that the Carolingian renaissance had given birth to. This meant the latest, greatest, 11th-century French versions of the Carolingian minuscule. These weren’t so different from the way Anglo-Saxon scribes had written Latin. But they were very different from the way they had written Old English, especially in the ‘g’ department.But that wasn’t so much of an issue, since these Norman-trained scribes, and those of the generations that came after them, didn’t write much English at all. In fact, writing in English of any kind was very scarce up until the end of the 12th century.Over the course of that tumultuous — and, for English, silent — century, the language had changed a great deal. All the scribes trained in the old, Anglo-Saxon traditions were long dead, so when a new generation of scribes turned their attention once again to English, they had to devise some new strategies for writing it.And this, after a surprisingly long delay, is where we first meet the star of today’s issue: ‘ȝ,’ also known as yogh. entirely different letterOr is it actually so bizarre?Modern English spelling is, of course, chaotic. So perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that we too have a very yogh-like situation with two of our letters: ‘c’ and — wait for it — ‘g.’A process like this happened in the ancestor of French too, just slightly differently. Instead of the ‘g’ being pulled forward into a ‘y’ sound before ‘i’ and ‘e,’ it got pulled forward into a ‘j’ sound. Back then, there was just one single language, which would later split into English, Dutch, German, Swedish, and all the other Germanic languages.And that’s why yogh has two sounds, each of which corresponds to a pronunciation of the Old English letter ‘ᵹ’ that the French scribal tradition couldn’t accept writing with ‘g.’When you’re reading Middle English, it can get a bit confusing: Which kind of yogh is which?Sir Gawain and the Green KnightSir Gawain and the Green Knightmodern readers of Middle Englishother letters unique to EnglishAnd Scottish printers were more eager to keep it than English printers were. So they took advantage of the visual similarity between ‘ȝ’ and ‘z’ — most forms of cursive writing in English still write ‘z’ like ‘ȝ’ — to write their yoghs with ‘z’s.And that’s how one single letter of the Middle English alphabet ended up being pronounced like ‘y,’ ‘gh,’ or even eventually like ‘z.’ I warned you it would be complicated. But the journey through the history of yogh has allowed us to peer down some interesting side alleys of the history of writing, from Carolingian scribal practices to the compromises of Scottish printers.I don’t lament the loss of yogh myself, not nearly as much as I lament the fate of other lost letters. But if the cause of yogh is one ȝou fancy taking up ȝourself, there’s nothing standing in ȝour waȝ (it’s included in many modern fonts), althouȝ I can imagine hiȝer causes to aspire to.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is SCL the Key to Faster, Safer Serverless Apps? Here’s What Benchmarks Say</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/is-scl-the-key-to-faster-safer-serverless-apps-heres-what-benchmarks-say?source=rss</link><author>EScholar: Electronic Academic Papers for Scholars</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 21:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[SCL leverages DataCaspules as the data representation to support inter-enclave communication. To quantify the benefits and limitations, we ask: (1) How does SCL perform as a KVS(§VIII-B)? (2) How do circular buffer (§VIII-D), and replication (§VIII-C) affect the overhead? (3) How long does it take to securely launch a PSL task? (§VIII-E) (4) How much does SCL pay to run in-enclave distributed applications(§VIII-F)?\
We evaluate PSL on fifteen Intel NUCs 7PJYH, equiped with Intel(R) Pentium(R) Silver J5005 CPU @ 1.50GHz with 4 physical cores (4 logical threads). The processor has 96K L1 data cache, a 4MiB L2 cache, and 16GB memory. The machine uses Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS 64bit with Linux 5.4.0- 1048-azure. We run Asylo version 0.6.2. We report the average of experiments that are conducted 10 times. For each NUC, it runs two PSL threads by default.\
B. End-To-End Benchmark of SCL\
: An end-to-end evaluation of SCL starts the worker sends the first acknowledgement to the user, and ends when the client receives its last request’s response from the workers. We evaluate the performance using a workload generated by YCSB workload generators. Due to the difference between get and put protocols, we focus on the read-only and write-only workloads. All workloads comply zipfian distribution, where keys are accessed at non-uniform frequency. For each get, we evaluate the performance of getting from the local memtable of the lambda(get(cached)), and of getting the data from CapsuleDB(get(uncached)). Each get request is synchronous that the next request is sent only if it gets the value of the previous get request.\
: Figure 9 shows the throughput of the end-to-end YCSB benchmark. The aggregated throughput of put. The get(CapsuleDB) throughput is flattened as we increate the number of the lambdas, because we run one single CapsuleDB instance that handle all the queries, which is bottlenecked as the number of lambdas that issue get(CapsuleDB) increases.\
C. Replication-enabled End-To-End Benchmark\
: Replication-enabled end-to-end evaluation measures the performance of the SCL layer with durability. In particular, it includes the overhead of workers sending each write to the DataCapsule replicas, a quorum of DataCapsule replicas receive data and persist it on disk, and then acking the worker. We evaluate the performance using a workload generated by YCSB workload generators. Since replication involves only write operations, we evaluate a writeonly workload. The workload involves a zipfian distribution, with keys accessed at a non-uniform frequency.\
: Figure 10 illustrates the performance of the DataCapsule backend. It shows that SCL with replication has reached a bottleneck after 9 workers while SCL without durability continues to scale. The performance drop and bottleneck are due to several reasons: 1) disk operations are inherently slow; 2) the burden on replication system’s leader is high for collecting acks from DataCapsule replicas and sending the aggregated ack back to worker. We aim to improve SCL with replication by mitigating the workload on the replication leader.\
D. Circular Buffer Microbenchmark\
 The circular buffer provides efficient application-enclave communication. We compare the perfor-\
mance of the circular buffer with the SGX SDK baseline and the state-of-the-art HotCall. We evaluate them based on the number of clock cycles required for communications in both the application to enclave direction and vice versa.\
: As shown in Table I, baseline SGX SDK incurs a significant overhead of over 20,000 clock cycles from application to enclave, and over 8,600 clock cycles from enclave to application. For both directions, HotCall is able to reduce the overhead to under a thousand clock cycles. Our circular buffer reduces overheads even further. Our solution only requires 461.1 and 525.54 clock cycles from application to enclave and vice versa. Compared to state-of-the-art HotCall, our solution provides 103% and 44% improvements, respectively.\
: We evaluate the launching process of PSL by running Workers and FaaS leader in SGXv2 hardware mode, which the worker lambda, FaaS leader and user on different physical Intel NUCs machines. For each NUC, it runs Asylo AGE in hardware mode with PCE signed by Intel that helps enclave generates attestation assertions. We assume the machines already have the pulled the prebuilt lambda runtime binaries and execute the runtime. The cold-start bootstrapping process lasts 42 seconds on average in our experiment setting.\
: Figure 11 show the latency breakdown of the launching process. It takes 0.30s for the user to reach out to the scheduler, and for the scheduler to find and forward the encrypted task to the potential workers. Then the workers load associated runtime and data to the enclave, which takes 0.16s. We parallelize the worker loading time with the attestation. that the user remotely attests the FaaS Leader to verify that the FaaS leader is running authenticated code in SGX enclave. After the worker’s enclave file is loaded, it takes 0.103s on average for the FaaS leader to remotely attest the\
worker enclave. We note that this attestation latency is mostly constituted by the network delay of grpc request and the local attestation assertion generation time of the worker’s AGE, so it does not incur scalability issue with the FaaS leader when multiple workers are launched at the same time.\
F. Case Study: Fog Robotics Motion Planner\
We experiment with a sampling-based motion planner that is parallelized to run on multiple concurrent serverless processes, MPLambda [23], and modifying it to use SCL. Most of the porting effort done was to integrate MPLambda’s build system into Asylo. The modification is about 100 LoC. Many system calls that MPLambda uses are proxied by Asylo.\
Using MPLambda with SCL, we compute a motion plan running a fetch scenario in which a Fetch mobile manipulator robot [17] declutters a desk. We measure the median wallclock time to find the first solution by the planners. We also measure the median average path cost per time of the lowest cost path the planners return. This captures how efficiently the planners can compute the best path. Because the planner uses random sampling, we run the same computation multiple times with different seeds. As with previous experiments, we run this test on Intel NUCs 7PJYH, equipped with Intel(R) Pentium(R) Silver J5005 CPU @ 1.50GHz with 4 physical cores (4 logical threads). We set a timeout of 600 seconds for the planners to compute a path.\
We run up to 8 planners, running on separate Intel NUCs using SCL and comparing this to running MPLamda without SCL. We observe an increase in performance as we scale out the number of planners. Each planner runs computationally heavy workloads and PSL introduces several threads (i.e. crypto actors, zmq clients, OCALL/ECALL handlers) that take away CPU time from the planner thread. Furthermore, MPLambda planners use the Rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT*) [24] algorithm, to search for paths by randomly generating samples from a search space, checking whether the sample is feasible to explore, and adding the sample to a constructed tree data structure. The tree data structure may grow large and take up a significant amount of memory. Memory in SGX is a limited resource and increased memory pressure leads to more misses in the EPC and requiring paging in and out of enclaves frequently. There is work on limiting the memory usage of RRT* by bounding the memory for the tree data structure, which we can adopt in future work.

Every PSL worker is started with a Worker Enclave in SCL, and attested by In-Enclave FaaS Leader. The code for PSL is directly executed on sandboxed Javascript engine. Our key distribution and management protocol provides every worker enclave with unique private keys derived from a master key by the FaaS Leader. The keys can be easily generated, verified and rotated to prevent potential key leakage.\
To isolate in-enclave applications from the PSL infrastructure, we use a sandboxed Javascript interpreter, Duktape, to dynamically interpret the Lambda program at runtime. In order for sandboxed Javascript program communicate with its other counterparts, we modify the Duktape and introduce two functions put and get to interact with SCL. We note that the program is transparent with and sandboxed from the underlying cryptographic schemes, so that it cannot observe and unintentionally leak the cryptographic secrets.\
PSL builds its attestation protocol on top of the Asylo’s attestation primitives. For each worker or FaaS leader that requires code running in the enclave, it starts with an Assertion Generation Enclave(AGE) as a Quoting Enclave(QE) that helps generates  on behalf of the enclave. The QE is certified by the Provisioning Certification Enclave (PCE), which uses Provisioning Certification Key (PCK) that is written, and distributed by Intel to sign QE’s hardware REPORT. The PCK certificate chain can be traced back to Intel SGX Root Certificate Authority(CA). After receiving an assertion request from a remote attester, the worker or FaaS leader establishes bi-directional local attestation with AGE to forward the assertion request from the remote attester and to get the assertion from the AGE. After the remote attester verifies the assertion, they establish a secure gRPC channel and the remote attester sends confidential information, such as crypographic keys, to the worker or FaaS leader.\
Each PSL worker node starts a lambda runtime in the enclave, which is registered with a third-party job scheduler. To launch a PSL workload, the user contacts the job scheduler with an encrypted program and corresponding launching configurations, such as how many lambdas are needed. The job scheduler contacts idle worker nodes within its registry and forwards the encrypted program to the potential worker nodes. To prevent malicious worker nodes, the user sends cryptographic keys via a separate channel through FaaS leader that runs in an enclave. After verifies the identity of the FaaS leader using remote attestation, the worker distributes the keys to the FaaS leader. The workers which receive the encrypted program also verify itself with remote attestaion with the FaaS leader. After the workers are authenticated, the FaaS leader forwards the cryptographic keys to the worker nodes, and the worker nodes can decrypt and run the program. When the PSL workload is finished, all the user-related confidential information, such as the content of the memtable, is cleared by a RESET command by the FaaS leader, because restarting the lambda runtime may take longer time. The FaaS leader keeps track of the idleness of the workers and only distribute keys to the idle workers. The workers after RESET need to be re-attested for the next PSL workload.\
In PSL, key management is needed for worker enclaves to verify each other’s identity, and to satisfy the security guarantees of DataCapsules. Our key management design goals are: 1) Provenance: by providing a  key pair per worker enclave; 2) Authentication: each worker enclave needs to sign with the (derived) DataCapsule  identity; 3), PSL uses a hierarchical structure with a parent FaaS Leader and multiple child Lambda Enclaves. We want to design a key management scheme to efficiently manage hierarchically structured key pairs with low overhead.\
To derive a each set of public/private key pairs from a master key, we use Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet from Bitcoin Wallet[30]. HD Wallet is a key management scheme that allows all the child public keys to be derived from a single parent public key. We use hardened derived child keys, a scheme of HD wallet to prevent the problem of HD Wallet that the leakage of the child private key leaks the private key of the parent. HD Wallet enables efficient key management in PSL as follows: 1) After attestation between the client and the FaaS Leader, the client sends its owner key to the FaaS Leader. 2) The FaaS Leader generates a child public/private key pair for the current running application. 3) The FaaS Leader uses the application child key pair to generate multiple grandchild key pairs, one per worker enclave. 4) The FaaS Leader attests and sends every enclave its grandchild key pair. 5) FaaS Leader multicasts the application public key to all enclaves. 6) Each worker enclave derives the other worker enclaves’ public keys using the application public key.\
 We enable efficient key rotation scheme with SCL that can derive and distribute a new set of key pairs for the workers from the new hardened key pair. This prevents the cryptographic key leakage over time. This is done by (1) client deriving a new child hardened key pair and multicasting the public key to all enclave workers; (2) the FaaS Leader then derives a new set of key pairs for the workers from the new key pair. To handle lost multicasted messages or enclave worker failure, we can rely on SCL’s consistency coordinator and include the current parent public key in the SYNC reports. This ensures that any enclave worker can verify that they are using the correct signing keys in a given epoch by validating the keys against the consistency coordinator’s SYNC reports. The frequency in which key rotation occurs depends on the user’s threat model. Users may choose to rotate keys per function invocation. This ensures any new function invocations may not affect previous function invocations.Our codebase contains 32,454 LoC in C++ excluding comments and 43,011 LoC code base in total counted by cloc[1]. The core SCL KVS code consisted of roughly 4,000 lines of code in C++, excluding the attestation, distributive application implementations, and experiment scripts. We implement the KVS directly on top of Asylo instead of on a containerized enclave environment. This yields a much smaller TCB than related works such as Speicher [9].\
Asylo is a hardware-agnostic framework for TEEs, supporting Intel SGX(v1 and v2) and ARM TrustZone. It also provided a POSIX compliant library that made it easier to port existing applications into enclaves. We use ZeroMQ to implement network multicast and communications between Worker Enclaves. We use gRPC to create a secure FaaS Leader Enclave, which can generate HD Wallet keypairs and startup enclave workers. We use DukTape, an embedded JavaScript engine in C++, to sandbox enclave applications, now that enclaves can directly execute JavaScript code.\
CapsuleDB is implemented in C++ and is 2200 LoC. It also uses several features of Asylo and the structures created in the PSL implementation. We use a similar memtable implementation, but leverage mutexes on each entry instead of a spinlock. Due to the implementation timeline, the current version of CapsuleDB writes data to disc rather than to a network attached DataCapsule using the Boost serialization library. The DataCapsule replication service contains about 1,000 LoC in C++ excluding comments. We use RocksDB as embedded persistent storage for each DataCapsule replica, ZeroMQ to implement network communication between DataCapsule replicas, and OpenSSL for signature and verification.(1) Kaiyuan Chen, University of California, Berkeley (kych@berkeley.edu);(2) Alexander Thomas, University of California, Berkeley (alexthomas@berkeley.edu);(3) Hanming Lu, University of California, Berkeley (hanming lu@berkeley.edu);(4) William Mullen, University of California, Berkeley (wmullen@berkeley.edu);(5) Jeff Ichnowski, University of California, Berkeley (jeffi@berkeley.edu);(6) Rahul Arya, University of California, Berkeley (rahularya@berkeley.edu);(7) Nivedha Krishnakumar, University of California, Berkeley (nivedha@berkeley.edu);(8) Ryan Teoh, University of California, Berkeley (ryanteoh@berkeley.edu);(9) Willis Wang, University of California, Berkeley (williswang@berkeley.edu);(10) Anthony Joseph, University of California, Berkeley (adj@berkeley.edu);(11) John Kubiatowicz, University of California, Berkeley (kubitron@berkeley.edu).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Manchester police name synagogue attacker as two men confirmed dead</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cx2703lnww4t</link><author>/u/fanastril</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 21:12:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Jewish festival of Yom Kippur has finished. As British Jews across the UK attended synagogue this morning for the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, many found out that there had been an attack outside a synagogue in Manchester. The horror filtered across the synagogue in whispers. It is a day of fasting, reflection and prayer, when Jewish people believe it is the day that sets how their year will go. The words used in one of the most significant prayers on this day: “on Yom Kippur it is sealed... who will live and who will die”. Today, terror came to British Jews at their synagogue, and many absolutely fear for their safety. Security is already mandatory for synagogues, Jewish schools and community centres, but it is unable to fully keep out the hate.Jewish people greet each other on Yom Kippur with a phrase in Hebrew "G’mar Chatima Tovah". It’s interpreted as "may you have a good and final sealing in the book of life".Two Jewish people in Britain lost their lives today and for the community here, some who over generations fled persecution to these shores, who always viewed Britain as a safe haven, but have been rocked by an increase in antisemitism, nothing will ever feel the same again.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mike Johnson says Democrats are handing &apos;keys of the kingdom&apos; to Trump</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-ss9feVGEg</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/m-ss9feVGEg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 21:12:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[House Speaker Mike Johnson blasted Democrats for the government shutdown Thursday, and warned their plan could backfire - arguing they’re handing “the keys to the kingdom” to former President Donald Trump, who’s poised to unleash layoffs and funding cuts.

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn emerged in late 19th-century London, capitalizing on a spiritual void created by the Industrial Revolution. Founded by William Wescott, William Robert Woodman, and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, the secret society claimed its authority came from mysterious "Cipher Manuscripts" and the "Secret Chiefs," ascended beings who provided them with ancient knowledge. The order's curriculum, a blend of various mystical traditions like Hermetic Qabalah and alchemy, attracted many notable figures, including poet W.B. Yeats, and was unique for its inclusion of women. However, the society's internal rivalries, particularly a power struggle involving its most infamous member, Aleister Crowley, led to its eventual demise by 1939. Despite its short lifespan, the Golden Dawn's legacy continues to influence modern occultism, with key figures shaping our understanding of magic and mysticism.

"We've already run out of data," Raphael said on the bank's podcast. He said this shortage is already shaping how developers build new AI systems. China's DeepSeek may have kept costs down by training on outputs from existing models instead of fresh data. The web has been tapped out. 

Developers have been using synthetic data -- machine-generated material that offers unlimited supply but carries quality risks. Raphael said he doesn't think the lack of fresh data will be a massive constraint. "From an enterprise perspective, I think there's still a lot of juice I'd say to be squeezed in that," he said. Proprietary datasets held by corporations could make AI tools far more valuable. The challenge is "understanding the data, understanding the business context of the data, and then being able to normalize it."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Big Ball of Mud: What You Need to Know About the Antipattern, How to Avoid It, and More</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/big-ball-of-mud-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-antipattern-how-to-avoid-it-and-more?source=rss</link><author>Yan Levin</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 20:40:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Probably the most infamous architectural antipattern in frontend development is the . The term Big Ball of Mud is applied to systems that have no discernible structure or modular organization. The codebase has grown organically and chaotically, becoming a maintenance nightmare. \
It's a situation many developers find themselves in, particularly when pressed hard to meet deadlines and develop a high volume of features. That's what the current article is about: the Big Ball of Mud antipattern with an example taken from frontend development, why it's so common, when it becomes a problem, and how to address this problem.What is the Big Ball of Mud?The  is a system with poorly defined architectural boundaries. Within such systems, code becomes entangled and highly coupled; hence, maintaining or extending the project becomes problematic. Over time, as more features are added without attention to the overall design, it becomes harder and harder to work with the code. Without structure, making changes in one part of the system too easily breaks other parts, inadvertently introducing bugs that further raise the bar on the complexity of development.\
In a , you will often see the following characteristics: NOAA clear separation of concerns: business logic, UI, and fetching of data are interwoven. NOAA loose coupling: the components are intertwined, and therefore, changes are difficult to put in isolation. NOAA modularity: every portion of the system depends on every other portion. NOAA global variables or shared states with unpredictable side effects.\
The Big Ball of Mud is a common result of high pressure to deliver fast without due attention to architecture. At the beginning of a project, developers are often in a rush to build functionality as fast as they can, with little time given to adequate planning. This leads to the growth of the codebase in every direction, with new logic being inserted wherever it could fit. Over time, refactoring is delayed or ignored in favor of shipping more features, and the architecture deteriorates.\
Other contributing factors to this antipattern include:: Developers are not coordinating with each other. Inconsistent coding and scattered functionality ensue. or architectural principles laid down to guide the development.: New features are added on top of what is already messy code without cleaning up the mess.\
Let's take a closer look at what the Big Ball of Mud might look like on an average frontend project.Example of Big Ball of Mud in FrontendHere's an abstract example of the Big Ball of Mud antipattern in front-end architecture. Consider a small React project that has grown into chaos over time./src
 /components
   /Header.js
   /Footer.js
/Sidebar.js
   /MainContent.js
   /UserProfile.js
 /utils
   /api.js
   /constants.js
 /styles
   /globalStyles.css
 /App.js
 /index.js
Issues With This Architecture:Lack of module boundaries: The components, say, , , and , all reside in one folder without any consideration for the role each of them plays. Components are responsible for fetching data, i.e., API calls, and rendering UI elements. Thus, the tight coupling between logic and presentation layers persists. The project depends on a single global CSS file. As your application grows, this might lead to conflicts in styles and will be even harder to maintain. Direct use of APIs in components: The method for fetching and updating data is imported directly into components like , thus mixing data-fetching logic with UI code.Sample Code from :import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { fetchUserData, updateUserProfile } from './utils/api';
import './styles/globalStyles.css'; 

const UserProfile = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUserData()
    .then((data) => {
        setUser(data);
        setLoading(false);
      })
      .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching user data:', error));
  }, []);

  const handleUpdate = () => {
    updateUserProfile(user)
      .then(() => alert('Profile updated!'))
      .catch((error) => console.error('Error updating profile:', error));
  };

  if (loading) return <div>Loading.</div>;

  return (
    <div className="user-profile">
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleUpdate}>Update Profile</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserProfile;
 Data fetching, state management, and UI rendering are all performed in one place within the component. The update of the API will force multiple components to be updated, because there is no abstraction layer between the API and the Components. Another component desiring access to user data will either reimplement the API call or tightly couple itself to this logic.\
This tangled, interdependent code is hard to scale and maintain, which is what a Big Ball of Mud is.When Do the Problems Start?A project featuring this type of architecture may not immediately have apparent signs of trouble. But as the project grows, so do the problems, compounding on top of one another: Changes become riskier because bugs in parts of the system unrelated to where the change was made can show up. Additional features set without refactoring involve architectural improvements that become more difficult to realize. Developers will start taking more time just to navigate and make something sensible out of such messy code, thus slowing down the development of features.\
The more knotted it becomes, the harder it is to untangle. Of course, this is just about the vicious spiral of growing technical debt and shrinking productivity.How to Avoid the Big Ball of MudTo avoid the Big Ball of Mud, good architectural habits have to be inculcated early and rigorously enforced during the development process. Some strategies follow. Clear division of your code into logical modules with responsibility boundaries. For example, concerns can be separated by data fetching, business logic, and UI rendering.: Abstract API calls and data management via services or hooks, such that these concerns are abstracted away from your components. This will help decouple the code and make it easier to handle changes in your API.: There should be a well-defined boundary between components. Instead of having all the components located under one folder, create separate folders for a feature or domain. Use libraries like Redux, MobX, or React's Context API for shared state management between components. This greatly reduces the urge for a component to manage the state itself. Refactor regularly. Don't allow the project to reach a stage where it becomes absolutely impossible to handle anymore; address these concerns while keeping the codebase clean.What to Do If You're Already Stuck in a Big Ball of MudIf your project has already devolved into a Big Ball of Mud, there is hope. The remedy is to  piecemeal, baking architectural principles in where possible. Start by: Focus on those parts of the code that are most painful to work with or extend. Incrementally refactor components to separate out concerns and limit dependencies. Now, introduce testing: Add unit and integration tests to make sure that your refactoring doesn't break existing functionality.In summary, Big Ball of Mud is a very common antipattern causing much trouble in frontend projects. Introduction of modular architecture, separation of concerns, and regular refactoring are definitely steps that would keep the chaos introduced by this pattern from your codebase, making it cleaner and more manageable.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Where It&apos;s at://</title><link>https://overreacted.io/where-its-at/</link><author>/u/steveklabnik1</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 20:36:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You might have heard about the AT protocol (if not, read this!)Together, all servers speaking the AT protocol comprise —a web of hyperlinked JSON. Each piece of JSON on the atmosphere has its own  URI:But where do they point, exactly?Given an  URI, how do you locate the corresponding JSON?In this post, I’ll show you the exact process of resolving an  URI step by step. Turns out, this is also a great way to learn the details of how  works.Let’s start with the structure of a URI itself.As you might know, a URI often contains a scheme (for example, ), an  (like ), a path (like ), and maybe a query.In most protocols, including , the authority part points at whoever’s  the data. Whoever  this data is either not present, or is in the path:The  protocol flips that around.In  URIs, whoever  the data is the authority, in the most literal sense:The user is the authority for their own data. Whoever’s  the data could change over time, and is  directly included in an  URI. To find out the actual physical server hosting that JSON, you’re gonna need to take a few steps.Let’s try to resolve this  URI to the piece of JSON it represents:An easy way to resolve an  URI is to use an SDK or a client app. Let’s try an online client, for example, pdsls or Taproot or atproto-browser. They’ll figure out the physical server where its JSON is currently hosted, and show that JSON for you.The above  URI points at this JSON, wherever it is currently being hosted:You can guess by the  field being  that this is some kind of a post (which might explain why it has fields like  and ).However, note that this piece of JSON represents a certain social media post , not a web page or a piece of some app. It’s pure data as a piece of JSON, not a piece of UI. You may think of the  stating the data ; the  prefix tells us that the  application might know something about what to do with it. Other applications may also consume and produce data in this format.A careful reader might notice that the  in the JSON block is  an  URI but it’s slightly different from the original  URI we requested:In particular, the short  authority has expanded into a longer  authority. Maybe that’s the physical host?Actually, no, that’s not the physical host either—it’s something called an . Turns out, resolving an  URI is done in three distinct steps:Resolve the handle to an identity Resolve that identity to a hosting Request the JSON from that hosting Let’s go through each of these steps and see how they work.The  URIs you’ve seen earlier are fragile because they use handles.Here, , , and  are handles:The user may choose to change their  handle later, and it is important for that not to break any links between pieces of JSON already on the network.This is why, before you  an  URI, you should turn it into a canonical form by resolving the handle to something that never changes—an . An identity is like an account ID, but global and meant for the entire web. There are two mechanisms to resolve a handle to an identity (also known as a “DID”):Query the DNS TXT record at  looking for Make an HTTPS GET to https://<handle>/.well-known/atproto-didThe thing you’re looking for, the DID, is going to have a shape like . (We’ll revisit what that means later.)For example, let’s try to resolve  via the DNS mechanism:The  handle  to be owned by , whoever that may be. That’s all that we wanted to know at this point:Note this doesn’t  their association yet. We’ll need to verify that whoever controls the  identity “agrees” with  being their handle. The mapping is bidirectional. But we’ll confirm that in a later step.Now let’s try to resolve  using the DNS route:That also worked! The  handle claims to be owned by the did:plc:fpruhuo22xkm5o7ttr2ktxdo identity, whoever that may be:This DID looks a bit different than what you saw earlier but it’s also a valid DID. Again, it’s important to emphasize we’ve not confirmed the association yet.Subdomains like  can also be handles.The DNS mechanism didn’t work, so let’s try with HTTPS:That worked! This means that  handle claims to be owned by the did:plc:5c6cw3veuqruljoy5ahzerfx identity, whoever that is:So you get the idea. When you see a handle, you can probe it with DNS and HTTPS to see if it claims to be owned by some identity (a DID). If you found a DID, you’ll then be able to (1) verify it actually owns that handle, and (2) locate the server that hosts the data for that DID. And that will be the server you’ll ask for the JSON.In practice, if you’re building with AT, you’ll likely want to either deploy your own handle/did resolution cache or hit an existing one. (Here’s one implementation.)Now you know how handles resolve to identities, also known as DIDs. Unlike handles, which change over time, DIDs never change—they’re immutable.These  links, which use handles, are human-readable but fragile:They will break if one of us changes a handle again.In contrast, the  links below, which use DIDs, will not break until we either delete our accounts, delete these records, or permanently take down our hosting:So, really, this is the “true form” of an  URI:Think of  links with DIDs as “permalinks”. Any application  URIs should store them in this canonical form so that logical links between our pieces of JSON don’t break when we change our handles or change our hosting.Now that you know how to resolve a handle to a DID, you want to do two things:Verify that whoever owns this DID actually goes by that handle.Find the server that hosts all the data for this DID.You can do both of these things by fetching a piece of JSON called the . You can think of it as sort of a “passport” for a given DID.How you do that depends on what kind of DID it is.Currently, there are two kinds of DIDs, known as , supported by the AT protocol:  (a W3C draft) and  (specified by Bluesky).The  handle claims to be owned by :To check this claim, let’s find the DID Document for . The  method is a specification that specifies an algorithm for that.In short, you cut off the  from the DID, append  to the end, and run an HTTPS GET request:This DID Document looks sleep-inducing but it tells us three important things: The  field confirms that whoever controls  indeed wants to use  as a handle. ✅How to verify the integrity of their data. The  field tells us the public key with which all changes to their data are signed.Where their data is stored. The  field tells us the actual server with their data. Rudy’s data is currently hosted at .A DID Document really  like an internet passport for an identity: here’s their handle, here’s their signature, and here’s their location. It connects a handle to a hosting while letting the identity owner change  the handle  the hosting.Users who interact with  on different apps in the atmosphere don’t need to know or care about his DID  about his current hosting (and whether it moves). From their perspective, his current handle is the only relevant identifier. As for developers, they’ll refer to him by DID, which conveniently never changes.All of this sounds great, but there is one big downside to the  identity. If  ever loses control of the  domain, he will lose control over his DID Document, and thus over his entire identity.Let’s have a look at an alternative to  that avoids this problem.We already know the  handle claims to be owned by the did:plc:fpruhuo22xkm5o7ttr2ktxdo identity (actually, that’s me!)To check this claim, let’s find the DID Document for did:plc:fpruhuo22xkm5o7ttr2ktxdo.The DID Document itself works exactly the same way. It specifies: The  field confirms that whoever controls did:plc:fpruhuo22xkm5o7ttr2ktxdo uses  as a handle. ✅How to verify the integrity of my data. The  field tells us the public key with which all changes to my data are signed. The  field tells us the actual server with my data. It’s currently at https://morel.us-east.host.bsky.network.Although my handle is , the actual server storing my data is currently https://morel.us-east.host.bsky.network. I’m happy to keep hosting it there but I’m thinking of moving it to a host I control in the future. I can change both my handle and my hosting without disruption to my social apps.Unlike Rudy, who has a  identity, I stuck with  (which is the default one when you create an account on Bluesky) so that I’m not irrecovably tying myself to any web domain. “PLC” officially stands for a “Public Ledger of Credentials”—essentially, it is like an npm registry but for DID Documents. (Fun fact: originally PLC meant “placeholder” but they’ve decided it’s a good tradeoff.)The upside of a  identity is that I can’t lose my identity if I forget to renew a domain, or if something bad happens at the top level to my TLD.The downside of a  identity is that whoever operates the PLC registry has some degree of control over my identity. They can’t outright  it because every version is recursively signed with the hash of the previous version, every past version is queryable, and the hash of the initial version  the DID itself.So far, you’ve learned how to:Resolve a handle to a DID.Grab the DID Document for that DID.That actually tells you enough to get the JSON by its  URI!Each DID Document includes the  which is the actual hosting.  the service you can hit by HTTPS to grab any JSON record it stores.For example, the  handle resolves to , and its DID Document has a  pointing at .The  handle resolves to did:plc:fpruhuo22xkm5o7ttr2ktxdo.The DID Document for did:plc:fpruhuo22xkm5o7ttr2ktxdo points at https://morel.us-east.host.bsky.network as the current hosting.And that’s how you resolve an  URI.Exercise: In the record above, the  is a link to another record. Figure out the handle of its owner and the contents of that record. Use pdsls to check your answer.To resolve an arbitrary  URI, you need to follow three steps:Resolve the handle to an identity (using DNS and/or HTTPS).Resolve that identity to a hosting (using the DID Document).Request the JSON from that hosting (by hitting it with ).If you’re building a client app or a small project, an SDK will handle all of this for you. However, for good performance, you’ll want to hit a resolution cache instead of doing DNS/HTTPS lookups on every request. QuickDID is one such cache. You can also check out the pdsls source to see how exactly it handles resolution.In practice, a lot of apps don’t end up needing to resolve  URIs or load JSON records because they  data from the network via a websocket and aggregate it in a local database. If that’s your approach, you’ll still use the  URIs as unique identifiers for user-created data, but the data itself will get pushed to you rather than pulled by you. Still, it’s useful to know that you  fetch it on demand.The AT protocol is fundamentally an abstraction over HTTP, DNS, and JSON. But by standardizing how these pieces fit together—putting the user in the authority position, separating identity from hosting, and making data portable—it turns the web into a place where your content belongs to you, not to the apps that display it.There’s more to explore in the atmosphere, but now you know where it’s .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Gaza flotilla rally outside Spain foreign ministry in Madrid</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO4rf4zxMko</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/RO4rf4zxMko?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 20:23:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Demonstrators wave Palestinian flags and hold banners outside Spain's foreign ministry in Madrid, supporting a flotilla seeking to deliver aid to Gaza.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is renewing a push for the US to change a decades-old phrase describing its stance on Taiwan independence, a concession that would be a major diplomatic win for Beijing.
China has asked the Trump administration to officially declare that it “opposes” Taiwan independence, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. 
The suggested wording is stronger than the Biden administration’s previous statement that US officials “do not support” the self-ruled island seeking formal independence, and would add to China’s campaign to isolate Taiwan on the world stage. The Wall Street Journal first reported the request. 
The Trump administration has not made a decision regarding the demand, and it’s one in a long list of asks from the Chinese side under consideration, according to a separate person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. A State Department fact sheet on US ties with Taiwan is currently unavailable on its website. 
Language defining the US relationship with Taiwan has long been a sensitive subject. In February, after the State Department abruptly removed from its website a phrase saying the US does “not support Taiwan independence,” Beijing swiftly urged Washington to “correct its wrongdoings.” Prior to that, the Biden administration removed the phrase in May 2022 but reinstated it after Chinese officials protested.
China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun reiterated Beijing’s position on Taiwan when asked Monday at a regular briefing in Beijing about the Chinese request. “Upholding the ‘one China principle’ absolutely entails opposing Taiwanese independence,” he said.

The program lets crypto projects give away branded devices that give out daily rewards in their own tokens. The move takes tokens out of exchanges and wallets and puts them into homes and everyday life.From In-House Devices to Whitelabel Expansionthe connection to a decentralized GPU network, and the possibility to generate daily revenue in tokens. Going a bit deeper, the team explained that, under the Whitelabel Device Program, rewards will be distributed in USDC through Codego’s app. The model has proven simple and effective: a device in the home that provides consistent daily payouts.The new program extends this framework to other projects. Partners can now release their own branded versions, with the same technology delivering rewards in their tokens.A New Layer of Utility for the Token EconomyIt is the team’s opinion that tokens existing only on exchanges risk fading from relevance. Tokens delivered daily through a tangible device gain visibility, trust, and persistence. Regular payouts create habits, strengthen loyalty, and give tokens staying power.Another important thing to mention is that projects can gain new channels for adoption. Also, users see tokens tied to consistent rewards, and not as abstract speculation entities. For partners, the model opens additional revenue streams through device sales and recurring margins.Strategy, Influence, and PowerThe team working at Codego has a clear long-term view for the project and the whole crypto community. For instance, here are three key features to consider:Home devices help the token's brand and presence stand out. Daily rewards make people closer to the system. This strategy makes it less convenient for anyone to leave ecosystems. Also, a token given out by a real system has the potential of gaining credibility on the market. This is because it’s possible to link real utility to a cryptocurrency. In other words, this system aims to go beyond mere speculation, and to enter the market with real, tangible value. Codego Group is regulated as an Electronic Money Institution and already provides services such as Banking-as-a-Service, Cards-as-a-Service, and Device-as-a-Service.The Whitelabel Device Program brings something new to the table, forcing crypto tokens from speculative devices to owning real-world utility. It builds a foundation where tokens integrate into daily life, offering relevance and stability in a volatile market. builds the financial and blockchain infrastructure that businesses and people use. It offers services for payments, banking, and devices. The recent launch is a big step in the company’s overall roadmap. In fact, it potentially increases the adoption of crypto tokens in various sectors.Partners receive USDC directly from Codego while distributing their own tokens to users through branded devices.Codego gives projects tools that make them more resilient and relevant by putting tokens into everyday life.

The retailer and technology vendor Wiliot announced the expansion Thursday. The sensors will monitor the location, condition and temperature of perishables as they move from warehouses to stores. Walmart started testing Wiliot's sensors at a Texas warehouse in 2023 and has expanded to 500 locations. The full rollout will cover the retailer's US store network and 40 distribution centers. 

The microchips measure 0.7 square millimeters and are embedded in shipping labels. They use Bluetooth to transmit real-time data about pallets. Walmart previously relied on manual scanning and paper checks by employees. The Arkansas-based company employs 2.1 million people but increased revenues by $150 billion over five years without adding workers.

The program is designed for CISOs, security leaders, risk managers, and HR professionals who are responsible for building security culture and reducing human-driven risk. Sessions will explore how to extend risk ownership beyond traditional awareness programs and the security operations center, empowering managers and employees across the business to take accountability. Attendees will gain practical strategies they can apply immediately from executives, global analysts, and peers. Participants with confirmed attendance may also request a completion certificate for Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits for the full conference.“Closing that visibility gap requires new strategies, proven frameworks, and collaboration across functions — which is exactly what HRMCon is designed to deliver. No matter where you are in your HRM journey, you’ll walk away with practical playbooks, proven strategies, and inspiring stories you can apply immediately. This isn’t just another security event—it’s a launchpad for making human risk a managed business function, all without pulling you away from your day-to-day responsibilities.”HRMCon 2025 will feature enterprise CISOs, Fortune 500 veterans, and leading analysts sharing research-backed strategies and real-world lessons on operationalizing human risk management.Opening Keynote – Brett Wahlin, CISO, Aurora – From Counterintelligence to Cybersecurity: Rethinking the Human Factor Across Industries.Risk frameworks have shaped enterprise security for decades but often overlook the human element.

Recently, I had the chance to get an Intellivision II console along the ECS (Entertainment Computer System) and keyboard. I found and typed a game Bomb Run 1, using its integrated BASIC language, and I was pretty surprised to see how incredibly slow is it.

Apparently, Mattel Electronics only developed the ECS to avoid paying a daily penalty of $10,000 dollars to the USA government because they were advertising a keyboard component that wasn't yet available. They developed the ECS in secret, while putting all their money in the ill-fated Keyboard Component which was a full 6502 computer around the Intellivision with an officially licensed MS-Basic.

After getting the ECS on sale, Mattel forgot completely about it. It is a shame, because the keyboard is reasonable enough, it looks nice, and it could have been a nice starter BASIC platform.
    Anyway, the turtle speed intrigued me as I was pretty convinced that the Intellivision processor could do faster floating-point, so why not write my own extended BASIC interpreter?

    For the remaining of this article, the original Mattel ECS BASIC will be simply called ECS BASIC.

The implementation of my extended BASIC interpreter is for a General Instruments CP1610 processor. This is a 16-bit processor introduced in 1975, with a resemblance to the PDP-11. However, General Instruments didn't allowed second sources, only wanted big orders, and ignored small requests (basically shooting itself in the foot), and this processor was used widely only in the Mattel Intellivision, and it ceased production in 1985 at the same time of the Intellivision demise.

A full documentation of the instruction set is available along the jzintv emulator that can be downloaded from http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/intv/.I'll be using the basic 8K words between $5000-$6fff for the BASIC language, and I'll ignore altogether the EXEC (the Intellivision BIOS) and the ECS ROMs (I didn't even bother disabling it).
    I never coded a full BASIC language before, because it was not needed. In the eighties, I had access to a Z80 BASIC that was already ported to the homebrew computer I was using, and in the nineties, I managed to put floating-point in the Li-Chen Wang's Tiny BASIC, do some statement extensions for it, and also tried to do a tokenized BASIC, but I never went too far.

I started in Sep/17/2025 by coding a floating-point addition subroutine. I didn't had a format in mind, it only had to be 32-bit because the CP1610 registers are 16-bit, so two registers fit nicely for keeping a floating-point number, and another two for the second operand.

The format was decided in the basis of how so easy was to extract the sign, exponent, and the mantissa with 16-bit operations, as 8-bit operations are difficult to do. This automatically discarded an IEEE-754 compatible format, and I settled for a format based on a 24-bit mantissa in the higher bits, followed by the sign bit, and the exponent in the lower 7 bits. The exponent is a bit smaller than the classic IEEE-754, but we get an extra precision bit.

    The code for extracting the mantissa is pretty short:

    ANDI #$FF00,R1  ; Remove the sign and exponent.
    SETC
    RRC R0,1        ; Insert the top bit of the mantissa (fixed one)
    RRC R1,1        ; Now we have a 25-bit mantissa,
                    ; aligned at the higher bit.

    I didn't define denormalized numbers, nor infinity and NaN (Not a Number), because this wasn't supported in the BASIC interpreters of the eighties.

    It was easy to get the subtraction routine once I got the addition subroutine working, because you only need to flip the sign bit in the second operand.

    I did later the multiplication routine, but I stumbled over a problem where sometimes the mantissa overflowed. I simply added a very complicated code to move the mantissa by one bit. It was several days later when I studied it, and I discovered you can only have a result of x+y-1 bits or x+y bits (where x is the number of significant bits in the first operand, and y is the number of significant bits in the second operand), and I could optimize it by simply inserting an extra zero bit at the left to account for the carry.

    Of course, I made a small test program to check for the validity of the arithmetic operations with several cases. It took me four days to code the fully functional floating-point library.

I couldn't start a BASIC interpreter without the keyboard reading code, and terminal-style output. Fortunately, Joe Zbiciak (intvnut) already had developed routines for reading the ECS keyboard, and I integrated these with a ROM header, adding along terminal handling for displaying letters, scrolling the screen, and moving the cursor. 

    With all this integrated I had a dumb terminal working, you type anything on the keyboard, and you get the same keys displayed on the screen. This was Sep/19/2025.

    The CP1610 processor cannot address directly the internal memory in byte terms, instead everything is handled by full words. I had to take this in account for my tokenized BASIC representation. A standard Intellivision doesn't have enough memory for a BASIC interpreter, so the ECS BASIC included 2K of 8-bit RAM.

    However, a few years ago, the JLP-Flash cartridge was manufactured and it provides 8K of 16-bit RAM over $8000-$9fff, so for my extended BASIC this was excellent.

    When I talk about tokenization, I mean that all the language's reserved words are represented with a token. This speeds up the execution of the language, as it doesn't have to run a word match each time.

    My first version of the internal representation for BASIC lines was the line number as a word, followed by a pointer to the next line, followed by the tokenized BASIC code for the line, ended with a zero word.

    As I coded the line insertion routines in Sep/22/2025, I discovered the pointer to the next line wasn't a good idea, because it needed to move  pointer after a line insertion. Instead, I converted the pointer into a length (the number of words used by the tokenized line). This allowed for a very compact code to jump over lines:

    INCR R4     : Jump over the line number.
    ADD@ R4,R4  ; Add the tokenized length to the current pointer
                ; Et voila! It jumped over the line.

    With the line insertion routines completed, I went to implement the BASIC tokenization subroutine. I decided against handling tokenization byte-per-byte, and instead made each token a word. Of course, it is wasted space if you are using strings, but it is faster on execution. Token numbers start at $0100. It only remained to interface the input with the new routines.

    I decided to read the text directly from the screen, very unplanned, and probably buggy, but it has worked for the current time. And maybe later I'll extend it for a full-screen editor.

keywords:
	DECLE ":",0	; $0100
	DECLE "LIST",0
	DECLE "NEW",0
	DECLE "CLS",0
	DECLE "RUN",0	; $0104
	DECLE "STOP",0
	DECLE "PRINT",0
	DECLE "INPUT",0
	DECLE "GOTO",0	; $0108
	DECLE "IF",0
	DECLE "THEN",0
	DECLE "ELSE",0
	DECLE "FOR",0	; $010C
	DECLE "TO",0
	DECLE "STEP",0
	DECLE "NEXT",0
	DECLE "GOSUB",0	; $0110
Excerpt of the tokenization table.
    Now I was able to edit, correct, and delete BASIC code lines. The next logical step was the execution of the program. I implemented  by reading each program line sequentially, and each token found choose directly the command to execute.

    My first program was simply  and I was happy when I typed  and the screen was cleared.

    This was followed shortly by  and . Where  was only capable of putting a string on the screen, and  changed the execution flow. I added a check for the Esc key to exit an infinite loop.

    I was also pretty impatient to see if my extended BASIC language was speedier than the ECS BASIC, so I decided to implement , and a small expression parser supporting the relational operators, and the basic arithmetic operators (, ,  and ), along numbers and variables.

    The numbers were simply read as integers and converted to floating-point format, while the variables used 26 double-word memory spaces covering the A to Z variables.

    In order to create a loop, it was required to implement variable assignment.

The tokenization of the BASIC program.

    For some reason, I couldn't type the less-than operator with the emulated ECS keyboard. Later, I discovered that intvnut missed the character in the Shift table, and it was a matter of a simple fix.
It was past midnight when I finally could try the benchmark. As I didn't had yet a  statement, I had to replicate it using increment and comparison.
I ran it, and I was amazed when I discovered it took only 15 seconds. In the ECS BASIC it takes 210 seconds! There are screenshots of the programs in the git.
More floating-point curiosities
    This wasn't the first time I programmed a floating-point package. My first one was for a Z80-based computer, I don't remember if it was complete, if it had bugs, or if it was actually used. What I can remember is that I was never able to make a proper subroutine for displaying floating-point numbers. I got stuck with a simple conversion to integer, and printing the integer. 

    The display of a number followed by fraction and exponent, for me was closer to black magic than anything. I believed that a single routine did everything, but I was wrong. And I came to illumination by reading a Commodore 64 BASIC manual, it says something like numbers in this range are displayed complete, while in other cases the number will be displayed in exponent format.

    This triggered a pattern in my mind: If the whole integer fits in the mantissa, display it alongside a small fraction, and if the number doesn't fit, make it bigger or smaller so it fits in an integer, and this one can be displayed in exponent format.

    The algorithm is as follows:

        The 25-bit mantisa allows integers up from 0 to 33554431. We limit it to the biggest integer all nines, or 9999999.
    
        If the floating-point number is less than 10,000,000 then the integer part is displayed, and then it gets 2 fraction digits.
    
        If the floating-point number is less than 0.01 then it is multiplied until it reachs the range 1,000,000 - 9,999,999. The first digit will be the integer part, the following digits will be the fractional part, and the exponent will be displayed along.
    
        If the floating-point number is greater than 9,999,999 then it is divided by 10 until it fits the same range. And again display like in step 3.
    
    And this way, thirty years later, I discovered printing floating-point numbers isn't so obscure as I believed, but indeed it has a lot of magic.

    The statements  allow to create small subroutines, and these have their own stack to keep track of where to return (a pointer plus the line number)

The  loop is one of the most known statements of the core BASIC language. Implementing this required a redesign of my execution loop, because I was doing it line-by-line, but the  changed the line, but on the next statement it would lost track and get back to the line following the .

The loops also require their own stack, but including the counter variable address, a pointer to the  expression, and a pointer to the  expression (5 words in total)

The  statement was replaced with a code that runs sequentially over the tokens, and jumps over the line headers. This way is easier to change the execution flow to a new token.

I also added the negation operator (required for ) and some functions like , , , and . The  function in particular allows to create little games for guessing numbers, and so.

Checking against the ECS BASIC, I was only missing , , and . So I bite the bullet to implement these. Adding along .
 for creating arrays was pretty easy, and I adjusted all the variable access paths of the interpreter in a way that any indexed access is the same as accessing a normal variable.

At this point, my extended BASIC language was already orders of magnitude faster than the ECS BASIC, and it could be used to write little text games (well, using only numbers)

However, it didn't handled yet the controllers, sound, graphics, and sprites. The ECS BASIC had some statements for it, but the sprites cannot be defined, and instead these had to be "grabbed" from a game cartridge. Of course, the user was limited to these game sprites. Also positioning sprites was done with multiple variable assignments in an array-like style of access.

For my extended BASIC I decided for a kind of advanced statements patterned after the ones from my compiled IntyBASIC language but not exactly the same:
 for setting the color stack mode. for setting the foreground/background mode. for defining GRAM cards. for setting the paint color used in . for displaying a sprite on the screen. for waiting the next video frame. for accessing the sound chip. for reading the 16 disc directions. for reading the side-buttons. for reading the keypad. for accesing the screen.
Once these were implemented, I started coding a minimal game to test the interpreter, and I called it UFO Invasion. Of course, I found a few bugs in my interpreter and fixed them.

The game was working, and at a reasonable speed. What about testing in real hardware? I loaded the interpreter into a LTO-Flash cartridge and connected my ECS system.

My first attempt crashed continuously. I lost half an hour looking for errors, until I noticed  crashed the interpreter. I had forgot to enable the extra RAM of the JLP cartridge. And finally it worked!

Typing the program was difficult, as the keyboard bounced a lot. This happens when you read too fast the keyboard, so fast you can see that effectively the key contact isn't perfect. I had to add a small wait before reading the keyboard, and it solved most of the problems.

    At the end, my extended BASIC interpreter was coded in six days! I think it is way faster when you are enjoying programming it.

A big difference against "standard" BASIC is the lack of proper strings. In the ECS BASIC, you could read a string from the keyboard using GET, and put it again on the screen using PUT, but that was all.

Adding the support for standard strings would mean it could run some text-processing programs like Eliza in BASIC, and some other small games could be easily translated.

This was one of the portability things that the BASIC language had at the time, and it was used by many books in a way that the programs were written with that "core" BASIC language in mind, and these could be typed into almost any computer with a decent interpreter.

The source code is released at https://github.com/nanochess/ecsbasic. I tried to release it so early as possible, so you can get a glance of how it was growing in the commits.

Enjoy it! After publishing this article in Sep/28/2025, several people pointed to me that I didn't explained why the ECS BASIC was so slow. Truth to be told, I was so happy with my working extended BASIC that I didn't even bother to look more on the ECS BASIC.First and all, there is a thread in Atariage about the ECS BASIC Color Patent, and the eighth post also by intvnut explains in great detail how he disassembled the code and found a terrible way of doing a shift of the floating-point accumulator.However, there are a few other details that make it slow. For example, the extra RAM is 2K of , and all the Intellivision memory accesses are for 16 bits (one word), so every single access to variables requires the SDBD instruction. This instruction tells the CP1610 processor to read the word in two steps.I did my own disassembly, and after giving a look around the same zone disassembled by intvnut, I found this code that extracts the exponent of a floating-point number:
 $E1DD: PSHR R5                                     
 $E1DE: MVI@ R1,R2                                  
 $E1DF: ANDI #$007F,R2                              
 $E1E1: MOVR R2,R5                                  
 $E1E2: ANDI #$0040,R5                              
 $E1E4: BNEQ $E1E8                                  
 $E1E6: NEGR R2                                     
 $E1E7: PULR R7                                     
 $E1E8: XORI #$0040,R2                              
 $E1EA: PULR R7                                     
It extracts the seven bits of the exponent. In the range $00-$3f makes it negative, and the range $40-$7f is converted to $00-$3f. So simply reading the exponent takes 7 instructions. Whoever developed this code didn't take in account that you could save the exponent in two's complement format offset by $40, and it is used nine times.For comparison, my code for extracting the exponent is simply .It gets worst when I found the code calling $E1DD, and it is for extracting two exponents and doing a comparison between both:

My code for exponent comparison is composed of only three instructions (two AND and one CMPR) This big code would be kind of reasonable if it wasn't for the fact that it is only called , and it is by the floating-point addition subroutine starting at $E059:
 $E067: CLRR R0                                     
 $E068: SDBD                                        
 $E069: MVII #$47D4,R3

 $E06D: SUBI #$0007,R4                              
 $E06F: JSR  R5,$E147                               
 $E072: TSTR R0                                     
 $E073: BEQ  $E081                                  
 $E075: MOVR R4,R1                                  
 $E076: TSTR R0                                     
 $E077: BMI  $E07B                                  
 $E079: ADDI #$0007,R1                              
 $E07B: CLRR R0                                     
 $E07C: JSR  R5,$E15E                               
 $E07F: B    $E067                                  
This routine calls the exponent comparison at $E06F, and if both are equal it jumps out to $E081, else it adjusts the exponent of one number, and  the comparison (notice the B $E067 instruction) The mantissa shifting routine at $E15E operates shifting in steps of 4 bits.At $E081 (not shown), it checks the sign of the second operand, and if it is negative, it calls $E194 to do a negation of the number.At $E091 it does the addition of the two numbers calling $E1C0, and calls $E183 to check if both signs are equal.The code at $E0A4 reinserts the exponent in a very slow way, and it ends by calling $E21A to normalize the floating-point number, again shifting the mantissa in steps of 4 bits.It has been just too much code yet, but let's look at the shifting routine:
 $E238: MVI@ R1,R2                                  
 $E239: MOVR R2,R5                                  
 $E23A: ANDI #$000F,R2                              
 $E23C: SLL  R2,2                                   
 $E23D: SLL  R2,2                                   
 $E23E: XORR R4,R2                                  
 $E23F: MVO@ R2,R1                                  
 $E240: MOVR R5,R2                                  
 $E241: ANDI #$00F0,R2                              
 $E243: SLR  R2,2                                   
 $E244: SLR  R2,2                                   
 $E245: MOVR R2,R4                                  
 $E246: DECR R1                                     
 $E247: SDBD                                        
 $E248: CMPI #$47CD,R1                              
 $E24B: BNEQ $E238                                  
It takes a byte, shifts it left 4 bits, inserts the carry, and copies the extra 4 bits as the new carry. I couldn't resist showing how it could be made a lot smaller and faster this way:
LE238:
    MVI@ R1,R2  ; R2 = 0x00ff
    SLL R2,2
    SLL R2,2    ; R2 = 0x0ff0
    XORR R4,R2  ; R2 = 0x0ff0 + carry
    MVO@ R2,R1  ; This saves the low byte.
    SWAP R2     ; R2 = 0xf00f
    ANDI #$000F,R2
    MOVR R2,R4  ; R4 = 0x000f
    DECR R1
    SDBD
    CMPI #$47CD,R1
    BNEQ LE238
This saves four instructions in the loop, and it is faster.The ECS BASIC has a mantissa of six bytes, so it has more precision than my extended BASIC (three bytes), but it is done in a very slow way!For sure the ECS BASIC could be optimized to run at least two times faster.Ok, but I haven't yet answered a simple question. How many cycles takes adding 3.0 and 7.0?I ran the jzintv emulator with this command line (remember we need a game cartridge so the ECS BASIC works):./jzintv -d -s1 -z3 Basketball.binI entered the R command to make it run the ECS BASIC. When I reached the ECS BASIC, I typed PRIN 3+7 and before pressing Enter, I went to the debugger window and pressed Ctrl+C. Then I put breakpoints at selected places (start of the floating-point addition, the place where it calls the addition, and the return instruction):Again, I typed the R command, using along M47C0 to watch the memory addresses where floating-point addition happened until I saw the numbers 3 and 7.I took note of the cycle number at the right. The operation 3+7 takes exactly 1558 cycles. By the way, the interpreter executes further three floating point additions when processing the numbers, and another two for displaying the number.
jzintv debug window with the ECS BASIC. The cycle count at the right shows how much time takes a floating-point addition.
Now, let's do the same with my extended BASIC interpreter.After assembling with as1600, I generate a .lst file where I searched for the  label (start) and  label (return) The addresses are $61d1 and $625b.I ran again the jzintv emulator with the debugging option, and I typed PRINT 3+7, and before pressing Enter, I stopped the debugger using Ctrl+C, and I setup these breakpoints:Then I entered the command R, and pressed Enter on the BASIC screen. It took me four R commands to see the values 3 and 7 in the registers, and the result 10.And the total cycles used were 479. This means that only in the floating-point addition the Mattel ECS BASIC is five times slower.

The main cause for this complexity is that the C++ standard can not give requirements like "do not engage in Vogon-level stupidity, as that is not supported". As a result implementations have to support anything and everything under the sun. For module integration there are multiple different approaches ranging from custom on-the-fly generated JSON files (which neither Ninja nor Make can read so you need to spawn an extra process per file just to do the data conversion, but I digress) to custom on-the-fly spawned socket server daemons that do something. It's not really clear to me what.Instead of diving to that hole, let's instead approach the problem from first principles from the opposite side.A single project consists of a single source tree. It consists of a single executable E and a bunch of libraries L1 to L99, say. Some of those are internal to the project and some are external dependencies. For simplicity we assume that they are embedded as source within the parent project. All libraries are static and are all linked to the executable E.With a non-module setup each library can have its own header/source pair with file names like  and . All of those can be built and linked in the same executable and, assuming their symbol names won't clash, work just fine. This is not only supported, but in fact quite common.The dream, then, is to convert everything to modules and have things work just as they used to.If all libraries were internal, it could be possible to enforce that the different util libraries get different module names. If they are external, you clearly can't. The name is whatever upstream chooses it to be. There are now two modules called  in the build and it is the responsibility of someone (typically the build system, because no-one else seems to want to touch this) to ensure that the two module files are exposed to the correct compilation commands in the correct order.This is complex and difficult, but once you get it done, things should just work again. Right?That is what I thought too, but that is actually not the case. This very common setup does not work, and to work. You don't have to take my word for it, here is a quote from the GCC bug tracker:This is already IFNDR, and can cause standard ODR-like issues as the name of the module is used as the discriminator for module-linkage entities and the module initialiser function.  Of course that only applies if both these modules get linked into the same executable;IFNDR (ill-formed, no diagnostic required) is a technical term for "if this happens to you, sucks to be you". The code is broken and the compiler is allowed to whatever it wants with it (including s.What does it mean in practice?According to my interpretation of thiscomment (which, granted, might be incorrect as I am not a compiler implementer) if you have an executable and you link into it any code that has multiple modules with the same name, the end result is broken. It does not matter how the same module names get in, the end result is broken. No matter how much you personally do not like this and think that it should not happen, it will happen and the end result is broken.At a higher level this means that this property forms a namespace. Not a C++ namespace, but a sort of a virtual name space. This contains all "generally available" code, which in practice means all open source library code. As that public code can be combined in arbitrary ways it means that if you want things to work, module names must be globally unique in that set of code (and also in every final executable). Any duplicates will break things in ways that can only be fixed by renaming all but one of the clashing modules.Globally unique modules names is thus not a "recommendation", "nice to have" or "best practice". It is a  that comes directly from the compiler and standard definition.If we accept this requirement and build things on top of it, things suddenly get a lot simpler. The build setup for modules reduces to the following for projects that build all of their own modules:At the top of the build dir is a single directory for modules (GCC already does this, its directory is called )All generated module files are written in that directory, as they all have unique names they can not clashAll module imports are done from that directoryModule mappers and all related complexity can be dropped to the floor and ignoredImporting modules from the system might take some more work (maybe copy Fortran and have a  flag for module search paths). However at the time of writing GCC and Clang module files are not stable and do not work between different compiler versions or even when compiler flags differ between export and import. Thus prebuilt libraries can not be imported as modules from the system until that is fixed. AFAIK there is no timeline for when that will be implemented.So now you have two choices:Accept reality and implement a system that is simple, reliable and working.Reject reality and implement a system that is complicated, unreliable and broken.[Edit, fixed quote misattribution.]]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ZLUDA update Q3 2025 – ZLUDA 5 is here</title><link>https://vosen.github.io/ZLUDA/blog/zluda-update-q3-2025/</link><author>/u/vosen_l</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 18:08:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Babel is why I keep blogging with Emacs</title><link>https://entropicthoughts.com/why-stick-to-emacs-blog</link><author>ibobev</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 18:06:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
Every time I look at someone’s simple static site generation setup for their
blog, I feel a pang of envy. I’m sure I could make a decent blogging engine in
2,000 lines of code, and it would be something I’d understand, be proud over,
able to extend, and willing to share with others.

Instead, I write these articles in Org mode, and use mostly the standard Org
publishing functions to export them to . This is sometimes brittle, but
most annoyingly, I don’t understand it. I have been asked for details on how my
publishing flow works, but the truth is I have no idea what happens when I run
the  command.

I could find out by tracing the evaluation of the Lisp code that runs on export,
but I won’t, because just the  exporting code () is 5,000
lines of complexity. The general exporting framework ( and
) is 8,000 lines. The framework depends on Org parsing code
() which is at least another 9,000 lines. This is over 20,000
lines of complexity I’d need to contend with.

It might seem like a no-brainer to just write that 2,000 line custom static
generator and use that instead.

Any lightweight markup format (like Markdown or ReStructuredText or whatever)
allows for embedding code blocks, but Org, through Babel, can  that code on
export, and then display the output in the published document, even when the
output is a table or an image. It supports sessions that lets code reuse
definitions from earlier code blocks. It allows for injecting variables from the
markup into the code, and vice versa. As a bonus, Org doesn’t require a
JavaScript syntax highlighter, because it generates inline styles in the source
code.

It does this for a large number of languages, although I mainly use it with R
for drawing plots. Being able to do this is incredibly convenient, because it
makes it trivial to draft data, illustrations, and text at the same time,
adjusting both until the article coheres. Having tried it, I cannot see myself
living without it.

A simple 2,000 line blogging engine would be a fun weekend project. Mirroring
the features of Babel I use would turn it into a multi-month endeavour for
someone with limited time such as myself. Not going to happen, and I will
continue to beat myself up for overcomplicating my publishing workflow.

Scientists have discovered that our planet has been reflecting less light in both hemispheres, with a more pronounced darkening in the Northern hemisphere, according to a study published on Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 

The new trend upends longstanding symmetry in the surface albedo, or reflectivity, of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. In other words, clouds circulate in a way that equalizes hemispheric differences, such as the uneven distribution of land, so that the albedos roughly match -- though nobody knows why. "There are all kinds of things that people have noticed in observations and simulations that tend to suggest that you have this hemispheric symmetry as a kind of fundamental property of the climate system, but nobody's really come up with a theoretical framework or explanation for it," said Norman Loeb, a physical scientist at NASA's Langley Research Center, who led the new study. "It's always been something that we've observed, but we haven't really explained it fully." 

To study this mystery, Loeb and his colleagues analyzed 24 years of observations captured since 2000 by the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), a network of instruments placed on several NOAA and NASA satellites. Instead of an explanation for the strange symmetry, the results revealed an emerging asymmetry in hemispheric albedo; though both hemispheres are darkening, the Northern hemisphere shows more pronounced changes which challenges "the hypothesis that hemispheric symmetry in albedo is a fundamental property of Earth," according to the study.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google’s Jules enters developers’ toolchains as AI coding agent competition heats up</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/googles-jules-enters-developers-toolchains-as-ai-coding-agent-competition-heats-up/</link><author>Jagmeet Singh</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jules is already being used by developers to complete code after experimenting on vibe-coding platforms.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It&apos;s easy to take image rendering in a terminal as granted, let alone video rendering.

This new ratchet enhances the Signal Protocol’s resilience against future quantum computing threats while maintaining our existing security guarantees of forward secrecy and post-compromise security.The Signal Protocol is a set of cryptographic specifications that provides end-to-end encryption for private communications exchanged daily by billions of people around the world. After its publication in 2013, the open source Signal Protocol was adopted not only by the Signal application but also by other major messaging products. Technical information on the Signal Protocol can be found in the specifications section of our docs site.In a previous blog post, we announced the first step towards advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an upgrade called PQXDH that incorporates quantum-resistent cryptographic secrets when chat sessions are established in order to protect against harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks that could allow current chat sessions to become compromised if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is developed in the future. However, the Signal Protocol isn’t just about protecting cryptographic material and keys at the beginning of a new chat or phone call; it’s also designed to minimize damage and heal from compromise as that conversation continues.We refer to these security goals as Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS). FS and PCS can be considered mirrors of each other: FS protects past messages against future compromise, while PCS protects future messages from past compromise. Today, we are happy to announce the next step in advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an additional regularly advancing post-quantum ratchet called the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR. On its own, SPQR provides secure messaging that provably achieves these FS and PCS guarantees in a quantum safe manner. We mix the output of this new ratcheting protocol with Signal’s existing Double Ratchet, in a combination we refer to as the Triple Ratchet.What does this mean for you as a Signal user? First, when it comes to your experience using the app, nothing changes. Second, because of how we’re rolling this out and mixing it in with our existing encryption, eventually all of your conversations will move to this new protocol without you needing to take any action. Third, and most importantly, this protects your communications both now and in the event that cryptographically relevant quantum computers eventually become a reality, and it allows us to maintain our existing security guarantees of forward secrecy and post-compromise security as we proactively prepare for that new world.The Current State of the Signal ProtocolThe original Signal ratchet uses hash functions for FS and a set of elliptic-curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) secret exchanges for PCS. The hash functions are quantum safe, but elliptic-curve cryptography is not. An example is in order: our favorite users, Alice and Bob, establish a long-term connection and chat over it regularly. During that session’s lifetime, Alice and Bob regularly agree on new ECDH secrets and use them to “ratchet” their session. Mean ol’ Mallory records the entire (encrypted) communication, and really wants to know what Alice and Bob are talking about.The concept of a “ratchet” is crucial to our current non-quantum FS/PCS protection. In the physical world, a ratchet is a mechanism that allows a gear to rotate forward, but disallows rotation backwards. In the Signal Protocol, it takes on a similar role. When Alice and Bob “ratchet” their session, they replace the set of keys they were using prior with a new set based on both the older secrets and a new one they agree upon. Given access to those new secrets, though, there’s no (non-quantum) way to compute the older secrets. By being “one-way”, this ratcheting mechanism provides FS.The ECDH mechanism allows Alice and Bob to generate new, small (32 bytes) data blobs and attach them to every message. Whenever each party receives a message from the other, they can locally (and relatively cheaply) use this data blob to agree on a new shared secret, then use that secret to ratchet their side of the protocol. Crucially, ECDH also allows Alice and Bob to both agree on the new secret without sending that secret itself over their session, and in fact without sending anything over the session that Mallory could use to determine it. This description of Diffie-Hellman key exchange provides more details on the concepts of such a key exchange, and this description of ECDH provides specific details on the variant used by the current Signal protocol.Sometime midway through the lifetime of Alice and Bob’s session, Mallory successfully breaches the defences of both Alice and Bob, gaining access to all of the (current) secrets used for their session at the time of request. Alice and Bob should have the benefits of Forward Secrecy - they’ve ratcheted sometime recently before the compromise, so no messages earlier than their last ratchet are accessible to Mallory, since ratcheting isn’t reversible. They also retain the benefits of Post-Compromise Security. Their ratcheting after Mallory’s secret access agrees upon new keys that can’t be gleaned just from the captured data they pass between each other, re-securing the session.Should Mallory have access to a quantum computer, though, things aren’t so simple. Because elliptic curve cryptography is not quantum resistant, it’s possible that Mallory could glean access to the secret that Alice and Bob agreed upon, just by looking at the communication between them. Given this, Alice and Bob’s session will never “heal”; Mallory’s access to their network traffic from this point forward will allow her to decrypt all future communications.Mixing In Quantum SecurityIn order to make our security guarantees stand up to quantum attacks, we need to mix in secrets generated from quantum secure algorithms. In PQXDH, we did this by performing an additional round of key agreement during the session-initiating handshake, then mixing the resulting shared secret into the initial secret material used to create Signal sessions. To handle FS and PCS, we need to do continuous key agreement, where over the lifetime of a session we keep generating new shared secrets and mixing those keys into our encryption keys.Luckily there is a tool designed exactly for this purpose: the quantum-secure Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM). KEMs share similar behavior to the Diffie-Hellman mechanisms we described earlier, where two clients provide each other with information, eventually deciding on a shared secret, without anyone who intercepts their communications being able to access that secret. However, there is one important distinction for KEMs - they require ordered, asymmetric messages to be passed between their clients. In ECDH, both clients send the other some public parameters, and both combine these parameters with their locally held secrets and come up with an identical shared secret. In the standardized ML-KEM key-encapsulation mechanism, though, the initiating client generates a pair of encapsulation key (EK) and decapsulation key (DK) (analogous to a public and private key respectively) and sends the EK. The receiving client receives it, generates a secret, and wraps it into a ciphertext (CT) with that key. The initiating client receives that CT and decapsulates with its previously generated DK. In the end, both clients have access to the new, shared secret, just through slightly different means.Wanting to integrate this quantum-secure key sharing into Signal, we could take a simple, naive approach for each session. When Alice initiates a session with Bob,Alice, with every message she sends, sends an EKBob, with every message he receives, generates a secret and a CT, and sends the CT backAlice, on receiving a CT, extracts the secret with her DK and mixes it inThis initially simple-looking approach, though, quickly runs into a number of issues we’ll need to address to make our protocol actually robust. First, encapsulation keys and CTs are large - over 1000 bytes each for ML-KEM 768, compared to the 32 bytes required for ECDH. Second, while this protocol works well when both clients are online, what happens when a client is offline? Or a message is dropped or reordered? Or Alice wants to send 10 messages before Bob wants to send one?Some of these problems have well-understood solutions, but others have trade-offs that may shine in certain circumstances but fall short in others. Let’s dive in and come to some conclusions.How does Alice decide what to send based on what Bob needs next, and vice versa? If Bob hasn’t received an EK yet, she shouldn’t send the next one. What does Bob send when he hasn’t yet received an EK from Alice, or when he has, but he’s already responded to it? This is a common problem when remote parties send messages to communicate, so there’s a good, well-understood solution: a state machine. Alice and Bob both keep track of “what state am I in”, and base their decisions on that. When sending or receiving a message, they might also change their state. For example:Alice wants to send a message, but she’s in a StartingA state, so she doesn’t have an EK. So, she generates an EK/DK pair, stores them locally, and transitions to the SendEK stateAlice wants to send a message and is in the SendEK state. She sends the EK along with the messageAlice wants to send another message, but she’s still in the SendEK state. So, she sends the EK with the new message as wellBob receives the message with the EK. He generates a secret and uses the EK to create a CT. He transitions to the SendingCT state.Bob wants to send a message and he’s in the SendingCT state. He sends the CT along with the messageBob wants to send a message and he’s in the SendingCT state. He sends the CT along with the messageBy crafting a set of states and transitions, both sides can coordinate what’s sent. Note, though, that even in this simple case, we see problems. For example, we’re sending our (large) EK and (large) CT multiple times.We’ve already mentioned that the size of the data we’re sending has increased pretty drastically, from 32 bytes to over 1000 per message. But bandwidth is expensive, especially on consumer devices like client phones, that may be anywhere in the world and have extremely varied costs for sending bytes over the wire. So let’s discuss strategies for conserving that bandwidth.First, the simplest approach - don’t send a new key with every message. Just, for example, send with every 50 messages, or once a week, or every 50 messages unless you haven’t sent a key in a week, or any other combination of options. All of these approaches tend to work pretty well in online cases, where both sides of a session are communicating in real-time with no message loss. But in cases where one side is offline or loss can occur, they can be problematic. Consider the case of “send a key if you haven’t sent one in a week”. If Bob has been offline for 2 weeks, what does Alice do when she wants to send a message? What happens if we can lose messages, and we lose the one in fifty that contains a new key? Or, what happens if there’s an attacker in the middle that wants to stop us from generating new secrets, and can look for messages that are 1000 bytes larger than the others and drop them, only allowing keyless messages through?Another method is to chunk up a message. Want to send 1000 bytes? Send 10 chunks of 100 bytes each. Already sent 10 chunks? Resend the first chunk, then the second, etc. This smooths out the total number of bytes sent, keeping individual message sizes small and uniform. And often, loss of messages is handled. If chunk 1 was lost, just wait for it to be resent. But it runs into an issue with message loss - if chunk 99 was lost, the receiver has to wait for all of chunks 1-98 to be resent before it receives the chunk it missed. More importantly, if a malicious middleman wants to stop keys from being decided upon, they could always drop chunk 3, never allowing the full key to pass between the two parties.We can get around all of these issues using a concept called erasure codes. Erasure codes work by breaking up a larger message into smaller chunks, then sending those along. Let’s consider our 1000 byte message being sent as 100 byte chunks again. After chunk #10 has been sent, the entirety of the original 1000 byte message has been sent along in cleartext. But rather than just send the first chunk over again, erasure codes build up a new chunk #11, and #12, etc. And they build them in such a way that, once the recipient receives any 10 chunks in any order, they’ll be able to reconstruct the original 1000 byte message.When we put this concept of erasure code chunks together with our previous state machine, it gives us a way to send large blocks of data in small chunks, while handling messages that are dropped. Crucially, this includes messages dropped by a malicious middleman: since any N chunks can be used to recreate the original message, a bad actor would need to drop all messages after #N-1 to disallow the data to go through, forcing them into a complete (and highly noticeable) denial of service. Now, if Alice wants to send an EK to Bob, Alice will:Transition from the StartingA state to the SendingEK state, by generating a new EK and chunking itWhile in the SendingEK state, send a new chunk of the EK along with any messages she sendsWhen she receives confirmation that the recipient has received the EK (when she receives a chunk of CT), transition to the ReceivingCT stateTransition from the StartingB state to the ReceivingEK state when he receives its first EK chunkKeep receiving EK chunks until he has enough to reconstruct the EKAt that point, reconstruct the EK, generate the CT, chunk the CT, and transition to the SendingCT stateFrom this point on, he will send a chunk of the CT with every messageOne interesting way of looking at this protocol so far is to consider the messages flowing from Alice to Bob as potential capacity for sending data associated with post-quantum ratcheting: each message that we send, we could also send additional data like a chunk of EK or of the CT. If we look at Bob’s side, above, we notice that sometimes he’s using that capacity (IE: in step 4 when he’s sending CT chunks) and sometimes he’s not (if he sends a message to Alice during step 2, he has no additional data to send). This capacity is pretty limited, so using more of it gives us the potential to speed up our protocol and agree on new secrets more frequently.A Meditation On How Faster Isn’t Always BetterWe want to generate shared secrets, then use them to secure messages. So, does that mean that we want to generate shared secrets as fast as possible? Let’s introduce a new term: an epoch. Alice and Bob start their sessions in epoch 0, sending the EKs for epoch 1 (EK#1) and associated ciphertext (CT#1) to each other. Once that process completes, they have a new shared secret they use to enter epoch 1, after which all newly sent messages are protected by the new secret. Each time they generate a new shared secret, they use it to enter a new epoch. Surely, every time we enter a new epoch with a new shared secret, we protect messages before that secret (FS) and after that secret (PCS), so faster generation is better? It seems simple, but there’s an interesting complexity here that deserves attention.First, let’s discuss how to do things faster. Right now, there’s a lot of capacity we’re not using: Bob sends nothing while Alice sends an EK, and Alice sends nothing while Bob sends a CT. Speeding this up isn’t actually that hard. Let’s change things so that Alice sends EK#1, and once Bob acknowledges its receipt, Alice immediately generates and sends EK#2. And once she notices Bob has received that, she generates and sends EK#3, etc. Whenever Alice sends a new message, she always has data to send along with it (new EK chunks), so she’s using its full capacity. Bob doesn’t always have a new CT to send, but he is receiving EKs as fast as Alice can send them, so he often has a new CT to send along.But now let’s consider what happens when an attacker gains access to Alice. Let’s say that Alice has sent EK#1 and EK#2 to Bob, and she’s in the process of sending EK#3. Bob has acknowledged receipt of EK#1 and EK#2, but he’s still in the process of sending CT#1, since in this case Bob sends fewer messages to Alice than vice versa. Because Alice has already generated 3 EKs she hasn’t used, Alice needs to keep the associated DK#1, DK#2, and DK#3 around. So, if at this point someone maliciously gains control of Alice’s device, they gain access to both the secrets associated with the current epoch (here, epoch 0) and to the DKs necessary to reconstruct the secrets to other epochs (here, epochs 1, 2, and 3) using only the over-the-wire CT that Bob has yet to send. This is a big problem: by generating secrets early, we’ve actually made the in-progress epochs and any messages that will be sent within them less secure against this single-point-in-time breach.To test this out, we at Signal built a number of different state machines, each sending different sets of data either in parallel or serially. We then ran these state machines in numerous simulations, varying things like the ratio of messages sent by Alice vs Bob, the amount of data loss or reordering, etc. And while running these simulations, we tracked what epochs’ secrets were exposed at any point in time, assuming an attacker were to breach either Alice’s or Bob’s secret store. The results showed that, in general, while simulations that handled multiple epochs’ secrets in parallel (IE: by sending EK#2 before receipt of CT#1) did generate new epochs more quickly, they actually made more messages vulnerable to a single breach.But Let’s Still Be EfficientThis still leaves us with a problem, though: the capacity present in messages we send in either direction is still a precious resource, and we want to use it as efficiently as possible. And our simple approach of Alice’s “send EK, receive CT, repeat” and Bob’s “receive EK, send CT, repeat” leaves lots of time where Alice and Bob have nothing to send, should that capacity be available.To improve our use of our sending capacity, we decided to take a harder look into the ML-KEM algorithm we’re using to share secrets, to see if there was room to improve. Let’s break things down more and share some actual specifics on the ML-KEM algorithm.Alice generates an EK of 1184 bytes to send to Bob, and an associated DKBob samples a new shared secret (32 bytes), which he encrypts with EK into a CT of 1088 bytes to send to AliceAlice receives the CT, uses the DK to decrypt it, and now also has access to the 32 byte shared secretDiving in further, we can break out step #3 into some sub-stepsAlice generates an EK of 1184 bytes to send to Bob, and an associated DKBob samples a new shared secret (32 bytes), which he encrypts with EK into a CT of 1088 bytes to send to Alice Bob creates a new shared secret S and sampled randomness R by sampling entropy and combining it with a hash of EKBob hashes the EK into a HashBob pulls 32 bytes of the EK, a SeedBob uses the Seed and R to generate the majority of the CTBob then uses S and EK to generate the last portion of the CTAlice receives the CT, uses the DK to decrypt it, and now also has access to the 32 byte shared secretStep 3.d, which generates 960 bytes of the 1088-byte CT, only needs 64 bytes of input: a Seed that’s 32 of EK’s bytes, and the hash of EK, which is an additional 32. If we combine these values and send them first, then most of EK and most of the CT can be sent in parallel from Alice to Bob and Bob to Alice respectively. Our more complicated but more efficient secret sharing now looks like this:Alice generates EK and DK. Alice extracts the 32-byte Seed from EKAlice sends 64 bytes EK (Seed + Hash(EK)) to Bob. Bob sends nothing during this time.Bob receives the Seed and Hash, and generates the first, largest part of the CT from them (CT)After this point, Alice sends EK (the rest of the EK minus the Seed), while Bob sends CTBob eventually receives EK, and uses it to generate the final portion of the CT (CT)Once Alice tells Bob that she has received all of CT, Bob sends Alice CT. Alice sends nothing during this time.With both sides having all of the pieces of EK and the CT that they need, they extract their shared secret and increment their epochThere are still places in this algorithm (specifically steps 2 and 6) where one side has nothing to send. But during those times, the other side has only a very small amount of information to send, so the duration of those steps is minimal compared to the rest of the process. Specifically, while the full EK is 37 chunks and the full CT is 34, the two pieces of the new protocol which must be sent without data being received (EK and CT) are 2 and 4 chunks respectively, while the pieces that can be sent while also receiving (EK and CT) are the bulk of the data, at 36 and 30 chunks respectively. Far more of our sending capacity is actually used with this approach.Remember that all of this is just to perform a quantum-safe key exchange that gives us a secret we can mix into the bigger protocol. To help us organize our code, our security proofs, and our understanding better we treat this process as a standalone protocol that we call the ML-KEM Braid.This work was greatly aided by the authors of the libcrux-ml-kem Rust library, who graciously exposed the APIs necessary to work with this incremental version of ML-KEM 768. With this approach completed, we’ve been able to really efficiently use the sending capacity of messages sent between two parties to share secrets as quickly as possible without exposing secrets from multiple epochs to potential attackers.Mixing Things Up - The Triple RatchetThere are plenty of details to add to make sure that we reached every corner - check those out in our online protocol documentation - but this basic idea lets us build secure messaging that has post-quantum FS and PCS without using up anyone’s data. We’re not done, though! Remember, at the beginning of this post we said we wanted post-quantum security without taking away our existing guarantees.While today’s Double Ratchet may not be quantum safe, it provides a high level of security today and we believe it will continue to be strong well into the future. We aren’t going to take that away from our users. So what can we do?Our answer ends up being really simple: we run both the Double Ratchet and the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet alongside each other and mix their keys together, into what we’re calling the Triple Ratchet protocol. When you want to send a message you ask both the Double Ratchet and SPQR “What encryption key should I use for the next message?” and they will both give you a key (along with some other data you need to put in a message header). Instead of either key being used directly, both are passed into a Key Derivation Function - a special function that takes random-enough inputs and produces a secure cryptographic key that’s as long as you need. This gives you a new “mixed” key that has hybrid security. An attacker has to break both our elliptic curve and ML-KEM to even be able to distinguish this key from random bits. We use that mixed key to encrypt our message.Receiving messages is just as easy. We take the message header - remember it has some extra data in it - and send it to the Double Ratchet and SPQR and ask them “What key should I use to decrypt a message with this header?” They both return their keys and you feed them both into that Key Derivation Function to get your decryption key. After that, everything proceeds just like it always has.So we’ve got this new, snazzy protocol, and we want to roll it out to all of our users across all of their devices… but none of the devices currently support that protocol. We roll it out to Alice, and Alice tries to talk to Bob, but Alice speaks SPQR and Bob doesn’t. Or we roll it out to Bob, but Alice wants to talk to Bob and Alice doesn’t know the new protocol Bob wants to use. How do we make this work?Let’s talk about the simplest option: allowing downgrades. Alice tries to establish a session with Bob using SPQR and sends a message over it. Bob fails to read the message and establish the session, because Bob hasn’t been upgraded yet. Bob sends Alice an error, so Alice has to try again. This sounds fine, but in practice it’s not tenable. Consider what happens if Alice and Bob aren’t online at the same time… Alice sends a message at 1am, then shuts down. Bob starts up at 3am, sends an error, then shuts down. Alice gets that error when she restarts at 5am, then resends. Bob starts up at 7am and finally gets the message he should have received at 3am, 4 hours behind schedule.To handle this, we designed the SPQR protocol to allow itself to downgrade to not being used. When Alice sends her first message, she attaches the SPQR data she would need to start up negotiation of the protocol. Noticing that downgrades are allowed for this session, Alice doesn’t mix any SPQR key material into the message yet. Bob ignores that data, because it’s in a location he glosses over, but since there’s no mixed in keys yet, he can still decrypt the message. He sends a response that lacks SPQR data (since he doesn’t yet know how to fill it in), which Alice receives. Alice sees a message without SPQR data, and understands that Bob doesn’t speak SPQR yet. So, she downgrades to not using it for that session, and they happily talk without SPQR protection.There’s some scary potential problems here… let’s work through them. First off, can a malicious middleman force a downgrade and disallow Alice and Bob from using SPQR, even if both of them are able to? We protect against that by having the SPQR data attached to the message be MAC’d by the message-wide authentication code - a middleman can’t remove it without altering the whole message in such a way that the other party sees it, even if that other party doesn’t speak SPQR. Second, could some error cause messages to accidentally downgrade sometime later in their lifecycle, due either to bugs in the code or malicious activity? Crucially, SPQR only allows a downgrade when it first receives a message from a remote party. So, Bob can only downgrade if he receives his first message from Alice and notices that she doesn’t support SPQR, and Alice will only downgrade if she receives her first reply from Bob and notices that he doesn’t. After that first back-and-forth, SPQR is locked in and used for the remainder of the session.Finally, those familiar with Signal’s internal workings might note that Signal sessions last a really long time, potentially years. Can we ever say “every session is protected by SPQR”, given that SPQR is only added to new sessions as they’re being initiated? To accomplish this, Signal will eventually (once all clients support the new protocol) roll out a code change that enforces SPQR for all sessions, and that archives all sessions which don’t yet have that protection. After the full rollout of that future update, we’ll be able to confidently assert complete coverage of SPQR.One nice benefit to setting up this “maybe downgrade if the other side doesn’t support things” approach is that it also sets us up for the future: the same mechanisms that allow us to choose between SPQR or no-SPQR are designed to also allow us to upgrade from SPQR to some far-future (as yet unimagined) SPQRv2.Making Sure We Get It RightComplex protocols require extraordinary care. We have to ensure that the new protocol doesn’t lose any of the security guarantees the Double Ratchet gives us. We have to ensure that we actually get the post-quantum protection we’re aiming for. And even then, after we have full confidence in the protocol, we have to make sure that our implementation is correct and robust and stays that way as we maintain it. This is a tall order.To make sure we got this right, we started by building the protocol on a firm foundation of fundamental research. We built on the years of research the academic community has put into secure messaging and we collaborated with researchers from PQShield, AIST, and NYU to explore what was possible with post-quantum secure messaging. In a paper at Eurocrypt 25 we introduced erasure code based chunking and proposed the high-level Triple Ratchet protocol, proving that it gave us the post-quantum security we wanted without taking away any of the security of the classic Double Ratchet. In a follow up paper at USENIX 25, we observed that there are many different ways to design a post-quantum ratchet protocol and we need to pick the one that protects user messages the best. We introduced and analyzed six different protocols and two stood out: one is essentially SPQR, the other is a protocol using a new KEM, called Katana, that we designed just for ratcheting. That second one is exciting, but we want to stick to standards to start!As we kept finding better protocol candidates - and we implemented around a dozen of them - we modeled them in ProVerif to prove that they had the security properties we needed. Rather than wrapping up a protocol design and performing formal verification as a last step we made it a core part of the design process. Now that the design is settled, this gives us machine verified proof that our protocol has the security properties we demand from it. We wrote our Rust code to closely match the ProVerif models, so it is easy to check that we’re modeling what we implement. In particular, ProVerif is very good at reasoning about state machines, which we’re already using, making the mapping from code to model much simpler.We are taking formal verification further than that, though. We are using hax to translate our Rust implementation into F* on every CI run. Once the F* models are extracted, we prove that core parts of our highly optimized implementation are correct, that function pre-conditions and post-conditions cannot be violated, and that the entire crate is panic free. That last one is a big deal. It is great for usability, of course, because nobody wants their app to crash. But it also matters for correctness. We aggressively add assertions about things we believe must be true when the protocol is running correctly - and we crash the app if they are false. With hax and F*, we prove that those assertions will never fail.Often when people think about formally verified protocol implementations, they imagine a one-time huge investment in verification that leaves you with a codebase frozen in time. This is not the case here. We re-run formal verification in our CI pipeline every time a developer pushes a change to GitHub. If the proofs fail then the build fails, and the developer needs to fix it. In our experience so far, this is usually as simple as adding a pre- or postcondition or returning an error when a value is out of bounds. For us, formal verification is a dynamic part of the development process and ensures that the quality is high on every merge.Signal is rolling out a new version of the Signal Protocol with the Triple Ratchet. It adds the Sparse Post-Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR, to the existing Double Ratchet to create a new Triple Ratchet which gives our users quantum-safe messaging without taking away any of our existing security promises. It’s being added in such a way that it can be rolled out without disruption. It’s relatively lightweight, not using much additional bandwidth for each message, to keep network costs low for our users. It’s resistant to meddling by malicious middlemen - to disrupt it, all messages after a certain time must be dropped, causing a noticeable denial of service for users. We’re rolling it out slowly and carefully now, but in such a way that we’ll eventually be able to say with confidence “every message sent by Signal is protected by this.” Its code has been formally verified, and will continue to be so even as future updates affect the protocol. It’s the combined effort of Signal employees and external researchers and contributors, and it’s only possible due to the continued work and diligence of the larger crypto community. And as a user of Signal, our biggest hope is that you never even notice or care. Except one day, when headlines scream “OMG, quantum computers are here”, you can look back on this blog post and say “oh, I guess I don’t have to care about that, because it’s already been handled”, as you sip your Nutri-Algae while your self-driving flying car wends its way through the floating tenements of Megapolis Prime.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Internet blackout in Afghanistan was not an accident | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PuCLf39BwIA</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PuCLf39BwIA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 17:45:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA['Waslat Hasrat-Nazimi, head of DW’s Afghan Service, highlights the severe impact of the internet blackout.

In fact, I would say that the majority of the code on GitHub I found was using earlier versions.There are enough breaking changes between those earlier versions and the current versions that I would strongly suggest to anyone looking to use these crates to just bite the bullet and use the latest versions, even at the expense of having less readily-available reference code.There are a whole bunch of API calls in Apple frameworks which can only be made on the main thread (seems like a lot of NSWhatever structs are like this) - it took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out that the objc2 crate workspace also contains the  crate to help with dispatching tasks to Grand Central Dispatch to run on the main thread either synchronously or asynchronously.While on the whole the experience felt quite "Rustic", there are some notable exceptions where I had to use macros like  to deal with Apple frameworks which rely on "delegates" and , the latter of which fills me with absolute dread.Once I was able to implement the equivalents of platform-specific functionality in komorebi for Windows, I was able to re-use the vast majority of the code in the Windows codebase.I'm still quite amazed at  work this required and the insanely high level of confidence I had in lifting and shifting huge features from the Windows implementation. I have been working in Rust for about 5 years now, and I didn't expect to be this surprised/amazed after so long in the ecosystem. I still can't quite believe what I have been able to accomplish in such a short period of time thanks to the fearlessness that Rust allows me to work with.As a bonus, I was also able to get the status bar, written in egui, working on macOS in less than 2 hours.In my experience, thanks to the maturity of both the  and  crates, Rust in 2025 is a solid choice for anyone interested in building cross-platform software which interacts heavily with system frameworks targeting both Windows and macOS.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trivy Operator Dashboard – Visualize Trivy Reports in Kubernetes (v1.7 released)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1nw9zo0/trivy_operator_dashboard_visualize_trivy_reports/</link><author>/u/raoulx24</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 17:22:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi everyone!

From a report: The vast majority of Asahi Group's 30 factories in Japan have not operated since Monday after the attack disabled its ordering and delivery system, the company said. Retailers are already expecting empty shelves as the outage stretches into its fourth day with no clear timeline for factories recommencing operations. Super Dry could also run out at izakaya pubs, which rely on draught and bottles. 

Lawson, one of Japan's big convenience stores, said in a statement that it stocks many Asahi Group products and "it is possible that some of these products may become increasingly out of stock from tomorrow onwards." "This is having an impact on everyone," said an executive at another of Japan's major retailers. "I think we will run out of products soon.

The objective of this study is to implement deep learning (DL) models using Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA), clinical data, and PE Severity Index (PESI) scores to predict PE mortality.\
 918 patients (median age 64 years, range 13-99 years, 52% female) with 3,978 CTPAs were identified via retrospective review across three institutions. To predict survival, an AI model was used to extract disease-related imaging features from CTPAs. Imaging features and/or clinical variables were then incorporated into DL models to predict survival outcomes. Four models were developed as follows: (1) using CTPA imaging features only; (2) using clinical variables only; (3) multimodal, integrating both CTPA and clinical variables; and (4) multimodal fused with calculated PESI score. Performance and contribution from each modality were evaluated using concordance index (c-index) and Net Reclassification Improvement, respectively. Performance was compared to PESI predictions using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups. Additional factor-risk analysis was conducted to account for right ventricular (RV) dysfunction.\
: For both data sets, the PESI-fused and multimodal models achieved higher c-indices than PESI alone. Following stratification of patients into high- and low-risk groups by multimodal and PESI-fused models, mortality outcomes differed significantly (both p<0.001). A strong correlation was found between high-risk grouping and RV dysfunction.\

At some point I realised that my setup was working against me. The moving parts and workflow I created added too much friction to keep my blog active. That happened mostly because it was a static generator trying to behave as if it was dynamic website with an editing interface. That can be done really well — cue Grav CMS — but that was not the case for me.Once I decided to rewrite this blog as a simpler system, I faced the dilema of what stack to choose. The obvious choice for me would be Javascript, it is the language I use more often and one that I am quite confortable with. Still, I don't think it is a wise choice for the kind of blog I want to maintain.Talking to some friends recently, I noticed that many people I know that have implemented their own blogging systems face many challenges keeping them running over many years. Not because it is hard to keep software running, but because their stack of choice is moving faster than their codebase.This problem is specially prevalent in the Javascript world. It is almost a crime that JS as understood by the browser is this beautiful language with extreme retrocompatibility, while JS as understood and used by the current tooling and workflows is this mess moving at lightspeed. Let me unpack that for a bit.You can open a web page from 1995 on your browser of choice and it will just work because browser vendors try really hard to make sure they don't break the web.Developers who built the whole ecosystem of NodeJS, NPM, and all those libraries and frameworks don't share the same ethos. They all make a big case of semantic versioning and thus being able to handle breaking changes, but they have breaking changes all the time. You'd be hardpressed to actually run some JS code from ten years ago based on NodeJS and NPM. There is a big chance that dependencies might be gone, broken, or it might be incompatible with the current NodeJS.I know this sounds like FUD, and that for many many projects, maybe even most projects, that will not be the case. But I heard from many people that keeping their blogging systems up to date requires a lot more work than they would like to do and if they don't, then they're screwed.That is also true about other languages even though many of them move at a slower speed. A friend recently complained about a blogging system he implemented that requires Ruby 2.0 and that keeping that running sucks.I want a simpler blogging system; one that requires minimal changes over time.One characteristic that I love about it, is that is evolves very slowly. Lua 5.1 was introduced in 2006, Lua 5.4 which is the current version initial release was in 2020. Yes, there are point released in between, but you can see how much slower it moves when compared to JS.The differences between Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.4 are minimal when compared with how much other languages changed in the same time period.Lua only requires a C89 compiler to bootstrap itself. It is very easy to make Lua work and even easier to make it interface with something.JS is a lot larger than Lua, there is more to understand and more to remember. My blog needs are very simple and Lua can handle them with ease.This is an old-school blog. I uses cgi-bin — aka Comon Gateway Interface — scripts to run it. It is a dynamic website with a SQLite database holding its data. When you open a page, it fetches the data from a database and assembles a HTML to send to the browser using Mustache templates.One process per request. Like the old days.You might argue that if I went with NodeJS, I'd be able to serve more requests using fewer resources. That is true. I don't need to serve that many requests though. My peak access was a couple years ago with 50k visitors on a week, even my old Racket blog could handle that fine. The Lua one should handle it too; and if it breaks it breaks. I'm a flawed human being, my code can be flawed too, we're in this together, holding hands.Your blog is your place to experiment and program how you want it. You can drop the JS fatigue, you can drop your fancy Haskell types, you can just do whatever you find fun and keep going (and that includes JS and Haskell if that's your thing. You do you).Cause I'm using Lua, I don't have as many libraries and frameworks available to me as JS people have, but I still have quite a large collection via Luarocks. I try not to add many dependencies to my blog. At the moment there are about ten and that is mostly because Lua is a batteries-not-included language so you start from a minimal core and build things up to suit your needs.For a lot of things I went with the questionable choice of implementing things myself. I got my own little CGI library. It is 200 lines long and does the bare minimum to make this blog work. I got my own little libraries for many things. Micropub and IndieAuth were all implemented by hand.At the moment I'm  having a lot of fun implementing WebMentions. Doing the Microformats2 extraction on my own is teaching me a lot of things.What I want to say is that by choosing a small language that moves very slowly and very few dependencies, I can keep all of my blogging system in my head. I can make sure it will run without too much change for the next ten or twenty years.Lua is a lego set, a toolkit, it adapts to you and your needs. I don't need to keep chasing the new shiny or the latest framework du jour. I can focus on making the features I want and actually understanding how they work.Instead of installing a single dependency in another language and it pulling a hundred of other small dependencies all of which were transpiled into something the engine understands to the point that understanding how all the pieces work and fit together takes more time than to learn a new language, I decided to keep things simple.I got 29 Luarocks installed here and that is for all my Lua projects in this machine. That is my blog, my game development, my own work scripts for my day job. Not even half of those are for my blog.I often see wisdom in websites such as Hacker News and Lobsters around the idea of "choosing boring" because it is proven, safe, easier to maintain. I think that boring is not necessarily applicable to my case. I don't find Lua boring at all, but all that those blog posts talk about that kind of mindset are all applicable to my own choices here.Next time you're building your own blogging software, consider for a bit for how long do you want to maintain it. I first started blogging on macOS 8 in 2001. I choose badly many times and in the end couldn't keep my content moving forward in time with me as softwares I used or created became impossible to run. The last two changes: from JS to Racket and from Racket to Lua have been a lot safer and I managed to carry all my content forward into increasingly simpler setups and workflows.My blogging system is not becoming more complex over the years, it is becoming smaller, because with each change I select a stack that is more nimble and smaller than the one I had before. I don't think I can go smaller than Lua though.A language I can fully understand and keep on my head.A language that I know how to build the engine and can do it if needed.An engine that requires very few resources and is easy to interface with third-party libraries in native code.I chose Lua because of all that, and I'm happy with it and hope this engine will see me through the next ten or so years.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Taiwan unpacks the Russia-China nexus | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MOHnVOLCAVM</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MOHnVOLCAVM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 16:37:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You can watch the entire interview here: https://youtu.be/s0whYJKja_0

A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.”This problem hasn't gone away with AI coding tools - it's getting worse, as managers assume engineers can now be productive in smaller time chunks.Over the past 2 years, we've studied hundreds of engineering teams to understand what the best ones do differently. In this article, we'll share their strategies and actionable steps you can use today. But first, let’s talk about deep work: The term was coined by Cal Newport, in Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted Worldbook [3].Deep Work is the kind of work that requires a big part of your brain power and usually gives some unique value. It can’t be done while distracted! If you can do a task during a Zoom call, it means it’s NOT deep work. is the opposite - things you can do without engaging 100% of your brain. Things like answering Slack messages/emails, reviewing a document, and so on.Software engineering used to be a haven for people who enjoy deep work. There is a reason why some people still think that software engineers work alone with their headphones in the basement.Today it’s becoming harder and harder to get those ‘Deep Work’ times - and I believe they are critical while using AI coding tools. Why Deep Work is so criticalWorking deeply is the only way to achieve the famous ‘flow’ state - AKA being in the zone.More deep work helps engineers to:Support their  - they’ll get more work done in less time, so more free time will be left. - in those focused times the toughest challenges are solved, and the biggest improvements to skills happen. A big mistake managers make is assuming that with AI coding tools, it’s no longer critical. That engineers need to get used to constantly task switching - as you anyway have to wait for a couple of minutes between prompts, so who cares about distractions. What happens then is that the quality of our thoughts and prompts go down. We fall into endless loops of asking the AI to fix the problems, while giving mediocre context.If you stay in the flow state, deeper in the problem, you’ll need many less iterations to achieve the same result. No data for this one, only my experience and gut feeling. So what’s the problem with deep work?Remote work should have been an answer to this - no commute, fewer distractions. In reality, only the first part is true.Since 2020, in addition to the 13.5% increase in total meetings, there has also been a rise of 60% in remote meetings[5]. The unsurprising part is that 92% of people say they multitask during those meetings[6] - and I would guess the number is just about 100% for software engineers.There are 2 main problems with that:1. Work that should be Deep, becomes ShallowRemember the simple test we discussed above? If you can do it in a Zoom meeting => it’s shallow work.A great example is reviewing PRs. If you have a busy day filled with meetings, when would be the best time to review them?During the meetings of course… reviewing a pull request should be deep work! Same for bug fixes, or writing design documents.Doing those tasks during a meeting starts a horrible cycle:The quality of the work gets poorer so more problems arise → more meetings are scheduled to address them.People are being distracted during meetings so no good decisions are taken → more meetings are scheduled…And it’s not the fault of your multitasking engineers - it’s the fault of your meeting culture.2. Engineers are not reaching the flow stateIt takes 15 minutes just to get going and only by the 45-minute mark (!) you will hit your peak, when you are fully immersed in the problem.[7]Every time you’re distracted, that clock resets thanks to context switching. In a study done by Meta [8], they’ve shown how severe the problem is - engineers get just 2 1-hour sessions a week! (And I find it crazy that a 3 minute session is considered ‘focus time’ at all). It was not just the time in meetings that is lost. Every distraction sets you back 15-45 minutes, leaving you by the end of the day with just 1-2 hours of productive time in the BEST case scenario.I love this analogy, borrowed from this Reddit comment[9]:Imagine developers are like miners. digging is our job. Every time you have a meeting, we need to pack our things, and get to the entrance of the mine on time. After the meeting is finished, we need to walk alllll the way back to where we were working, assuming we even remember the right path...So if you want us to get you some diamonds, let us work in peace.Software engineers need at least 4-5 hours of uninterrupted time a day, and it’s our job as managers to provide it.How can we create deep work timeImprove the meeting culture at your companyIt’s not that hard to fix - you ‘just’ need to get all the managers to commit to basic rules:Meetings should be  - obvious right? But still rare… Have a clear agenda, and clear outcomes.Have a fixed daily time for meetings - and leave big chunks of ‘no-meetings’ time. You can either do no-meeting days, or no-meeting hours, it depends on your organization. Invite only people who are really needed - this is something that remote work is bad at - it has become too easy to just invite everyone. People think to themselves: “Worst case, they’ll multitask, and be available in case they are needed”.This is an awful approach! Remember - you cannot achieve a flow state while multitasking.But the best way? Get rid of as many meetings as you can! In the past 2 years, we’ve studied how hundreds of engineering teams operate. The engineering team at Pylon really impressed us. When we asked to see a senior engineer's calendar for the week, it was completely empty. No standups, no sprint planning, no recurring meetings of any kind.There's still plenty of collaboration, but it happens instead of recurring meetings. This is probably possible because they're in person 5 days a week, but even in remote settings you for sure can get rid of some meetings. And if you can’t get rid of all meetings, we recommend at least having some company-wide blocks of focus time. After analyzing data 600,000+ PRs at Weave, the data shows that most engineers are the most productive at 09:00-11:00 and 14:00-16:00: *Note: Those are just commit times, and we know that probably people work in the hours before that (and that there is a lunch break). Still, our point is that there are 'clusters' of productive times, and you should not fragment your people's workday!Rethink your PRs workflowBetter yet, do you actually need all those PRs?The other thing that surprised us about that team at Pylon is that they have almost no code reviews. Engineers merge their own code and only request reviews if they need input, think they have a risky change, or are still onboarding.Code reviews are a big distraction on both sides - when it comes your way you want to do it as fast as possible to not block others, and when the answer comes you are tempted to look at it and address it immediately. In both cases, it can ruin the flow state.This goes against conventional wisdom about code quality, but their thought process is simple: if you hire skilled engineers and trust them, there's no reason to bottleneck every change with mandatory reviews.Once you get the meetings under control, you can deal with the other interruptions.The best way to create a good culture is to cherish your own deep work time, and make sure your team respects it. I have to admit that I’m still struggling with this one - I schedule focus time in my calendar, and put on my headphones, but I still sometimes check Slack and answer when interrupted.I know this sets a bad example for my team - deep work time should be sacred, and people should know it’s completely acceptable to not be available in Slack for a couple of hours.Focus time in 2025 becomes critical I believe that the more we start to depend on AI, the more important focus time will become. The models will become much faster with time, and I believe that companies and engineers who learn to enter the flow state  AI will hugely outpace everyone else.[1] https://www.notta.ai/en/blog/meeting-statistics[2] https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html[3] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work[4] https://hbr.org/2014/05/create-a-work-environment-that-fosters-flow[5] https://www.cfo.com/news/remote-meetings-up-60-since-2020-weekly-stat/654749/[6] https://www.flowtrace.co/collaboration-blog/50-meeting-statistics[7] https://www.locationrebel.com/flow-state/#:~:text=The%20science%20shows%20us%20that,disturb%20you%20until%20after%20lunch.[8] https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~pcr/paper/YChen2022ICSE-industry-preprint.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com[9] https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1bbcoec/comment/ku9i16h/]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rust in Production Podcast: Amazon Prime Video rewrote their streaming app in Rust (30ms input latency)</title><link>https://corrode.dev/podcast/s05e01-prime-video/</link><author>/u/mre__</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 16:23:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you one of over 240 million subscribers of Amazon’s Prime Video service?

Brazil’s Pix moves more than $1 trillion a year, Peru is standardizing QR payments, and Mexico’s SPEI has become everyday infrastructure. On the surface, it looks like pure tech adoption. But beneath that growth lies a less glamorous, more decisive factor: regulation.At LaFinteca, we’ve just added a new license to our regulatory footprint. The Central Bank of Brazil has authorized us as an Instituição de Pagamento (Electronic Money Institution) — a license that puts us under direct regulatory supervision in the country. For us, this is not only a compliance milestone. It’s the foundation for building a payment ecosystem that merchants and consumers can trust for the long haul.Operating without oversight might look faster in the short term. In reality, it creates fragility: opaque onboarding, patchy settlement, and exposure to regulatory intervention. Licensing flips that script. It forces infrastructure to be transparent, auditable, and built for scale.In Brazil, where more than 140 million people use digital payments, that level of trust isn’t optional. It’s a precondition for growth.Our approach is simple: compliance first, product second. By aligning with Brazil’s EMI framework, we are able to integrate directly with Pix and move forward with the next steps required for wallet infrastructure, merchant settlement, and API development — all under the guardrails of one of the most respected regulators in the region.It’s not the fastest route on paper, but it’s the most sustainable one in practice.For businesses looking to enter LATAM, licensing translates into clarity:Predictable operations: Merchants know payments will flow under national financial law.Fewer surprises: Settlement and reconciliation are designed with regulatory checks in mind.Scalability: Compliance isn’t a bottleneck; it’s what allows scale without disruption.Regulation doesn’t make the headlines the way flashy product launches do. Yet it’s the reason those products can endure. For LaFinteca, Brazil’s new EMI license is not the finish line — it’s the platform from which the next phase of secure, scalable, cross-border payments in LATAM will be built.LaFinteca is a Barcelona- and São Paulo-based payment institution building seamless financial infrastructure for Latin America. Through a single integration, LaFinteca enables merchants to access local payment rails while ensuring compliance with national regulations. Our mission is to simplify payments, accelerate cross-border trade, and expand financial inclusion across the region.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Measuring the Universe&apos;s Expansion</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cp0le2TusRU</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cp0le2TusRU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 16:15:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

This new ratchet enhances the Signal Protocol’s resilience against future quantum computing threats while maintaining our existing security guarantees of forward secrecy and post-compromise security.The Signal Protocol is a set of cryptographic specifications that provides end-to-end encryption for private communications exchanged daily by billions of people around the world. After its publication in 2013, the open source Signal Protocol was adopted not only by the Signal application but also by other major messaging products. Technical information on the Signal Protocol can be found in the specifications section of our docs site.In a previous blog post, we announced the first step towards advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an upgrade called PQXDH that incorporates quantum-resistent cryptographic secrets when chat sessions are established in order to protect against harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks that could allow current chat sessions to become compromised if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is developed in the future. However, the Signal Protocol isn’t just about protecting cryptographic material and keys at the beginning of a new chat or phone call; it’s also designed to minimize damage and heal from compromise as that conversation continues.We refer to these security goals as Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS). FS and PCS can be considered mirrors of each other: FS protects past messages against future compromise, while PCS protects future messages from past compromise. Today, we are happy to announce the next step in advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an additional regularly advancing post-quantum ratchet called the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR. On its own, SPQR provides secure messaging that provably achieves these FS and PCS guarantees in a quantum safe manner. We mix the output of this new ratcheting protocol with Signal’s existing Double Ratchet, in a combination we refer to as the Triple Ratchet.What does this mean for you as a Signal user? First, when it comes to your experience using the app, nothing changes. Second, because of how we’re rolling this out and mixing it in with our existing encryption, eventually all of your conversations will move to this new protocol without you needing to take any action. Third, and most importantly, this protects your communications both now and in the event that cryptographically relevant quantum computers eventually become a reality, and it allows us to maintain our existing security guarantees of forward secrecy and post-compromise security as we proactively prepare for that new world.The Current State of the Signal ProtocolThe original Signal ratchet uses hash functions for FS and a set of elliptic-curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) secret exchanges for PCS. The hash functions are quantum safe, but elliptic-curve cryptography is not. An example is in order: our favorite users, Alice and Bob, establish a long-term connection and chat over it regularly. During that session’s lifetime, Alice and Bob regularly agree on new ECDH secrets and use them to “ratchet” their session. Mean ol’ Mallory records the entire (encrypted) communication, and really wants to know what Alice and Bob are talking about.The concept of a “ratchet” is crucial to our current non-quantum FS/PCS protection. In the physical world, a ratchet is a mechanism that allows a gear to rotate forward, but disallows rotation backwards. In the Signal Protocol, it takes on a similar role. When Alice and Bob “ratchet” their session, they replace the set of keys they were using prior with a new set based on both the older secrets and a new one they agree upon. Given access to those new secrets, though, there’s no (non-quantum) way to compute the older secrets. By being “one-way”, this ratcheting mechanism provides FS.The ECDH mechanism allows Alice and Bob to generate new, small (32 bytes) data blobs and attach them to every message. Whenever each party receives a message from the other, they can locally (and relatively cheaply) use this data blob to agree on a new shared secret, then use that secret to ratchet their side of the protocol. Crucially, ECDH also allows Alice and Bob to both agree on the new secret without sending that secret itself over their session, and in fact without sending anything over the session that Mallory could use to determine it. This description of Diffie-Hellman key exchange provides more details on the concepts of such a key exchange, and this description of ECDH provides specific details on the variant used by the current Signal protocol.Sometime midway through the lifetime of Alice and Bob’s session, Mallory successfully breaches the defences of both Alice and Bob, gaining access to all of the (current) secrets used for their session at the time of request. Alice and Bob should have the benefits of Forward Secrecy - they’ve ratcheted sometime recently before the compromise, so no messages earlier than their last ratchet are accessible to Mallory, since ratcheting isn’t reversible. They also retain the benefits of Post-Compromise Security. Their ratcheting after Mallory’s secret access agrees upon new keys that can’t be gleaned just from the captured data they pass between each other, re-securing the session.Should Mallory have access to a quantum computer, though, things aren’t so simple. Because elliptic curve cryptography is not quantum resistant, it’s possible that Mallory could glean access to the secret that Alice and Bob agreed upon, just by looking at the communication between them. Given this, Alice and Bob’s session will never “heal”; Mallory’s access to their network traffic from this point forward will allow her to decrypt all future communications.Mixing In Quantum SecurityIn order to make our security guarantees stand up to quantum attacks, we need to mix in secrets generated from quantum secure algorithms. In PQXDH, we did this by performing an additional round of key agreement during the session-initiating handshake, then mixing the resulting shared secret into the initial secret material used to create Signal sessions. To handle FS and PCS, we need to do continuous key agreement, where over the lifetime of a session we keep generating new shared secrets and mixing those keys into our encryption keys.Luckily there is a tool designed exactly for this purpose: the quantum-secure Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM). KEMs share similar behavior to the Diffie-Hellman mechanisms we described earlier, where two clients provide each other with information, eventually deciding on a shared secret, without anyone who intercepts their communications being able to access that secret. However, there is one important distinction for KEMs - they require ordered, asymmetric messages to be passed between their clients. In ECDH, both clients send the other some public parameters, and both combine these parameters with their locally held secrets and come up with an identical shared secret. In the standardized ML-KEM key-encapsulation mechanism, though, the initiating client generates a pair of encapsulation key (EK) and decapsulation key (DK) (analogous to a public and private key respectively) and sends the EK. The receiving client receives it, generates a secret, and wraps it into a ciphertext (CT) with that key. The initiating client receives that CT and decapsulates with its previously generated DK. In the end, both clients have access to the new, shared secret, just through slightly different means.Wanting to integrate this quantum-secure key sharing into Signal, we could take a simple, naive approach for each session. When Alice initiates a session with Bob,Alice, with every message she sends, sends an EKBob, with every message he receives, generates a secret and a CT, and sends the CT backAlice, on receiving a CT, extracts the secret with her DK and mixes it inThis initially simple-looking approach, though, quickly runs into a number of issues we’ll need to address to make our protocol actually robust. First, encapsulation keys and CTs are large - over 1000 bytes each for ML-KEM 768, compared to the 32 bytes required for ECDH. Second, while this protocol works well when both clients are online, what happens when a client is offline? Or a message is dropped or reordered? Or Alice wants to send 10 messages before Bob wants to send one?Some of these problems have well-understood solutions, but others have trade-offs that may shine in certain circumstances but fall short in others. Let’s dive in and come to some conclusions.How does Alice decide what to send based on what Bob needs next, and vice versa? If Bob hasn’t received an EK yet, she shouldn’t send the next one. What does Bob send when he hasn’t yet received an EK from Alice, or when he has, but he’s already responded to it? This is a common problem when remote parties send messages to communicate, so there’s a good, well-understood solution: a state machine. Alice and Bob both keep track of “what state am I in”, and base their decisions on that. When sending or receiving a message, they might also change their state. For example:Alice wants to send a message, but she’s in a StartingA state, so she doesn’t have an EK. So, she generates an EK/DK pair, stores them locally, and transitions to the SendEK stateAlice wants to send a message and is in the SendEK state. She sends the EK along with the messageAlice wants to send another message, but she’s still in the SendEK state. So, she sends the EK with the new message as wellBob receives the message with the EK. He generates a secret and uses the EK to create a CT. He transitions to the SendingCT state.Bob wants to send a message and he’s in the SendingCT state. He sends the CT along with the messageBob wants to send a message and he’s in the SendingCT state. He sends the CT along with the messageBy crafting a set of states and transitions, both sides can coordinate what’s sent. Note, though, that even in this simple case, we see problems. For example, we’re sending our (large) EK and (large) CT multiple times.We’ve already mentioned that the size of the data we’re sending has increased pretty drastically, from 32 bytes to over 1000 per message. But bandwidth is expensive, especially on consumer devices like client phones, that may be anywhere in the world and have extremely varied costs for sending bytes over the wire. So let’s discuss strategies for conserving that bandwidth.First, the simplest approach - don’t send a new key with every message. Just, for example, send with every 50 messages, or once a week, or every 50 messages unless you haven’t sent a key in a week, or any other combination of options. All of these approaches tend to work pretty well in online cases, where both sides of a session are communicating in real-time with no message loss. But in cases where one side is offline or loss can occur, they can be problematic. Consider the case of “send a key if you haven’t sent one in a week”. If Bob has been offline for 2 weeks, what does Alice do when she wants to send a message? What happens if we can lose messages, and we lose the one in fifty that contains a new key? Or, what happens if there’s an attacker in the middle that wants to stop us from generating new secrets, and can look for messages that are 1000 bytes larger than the others and drop them, only allowing keyless messages through?Another method is to chunk up a message. Want to send 1000 bytes? Send 10 chunks of 100 bytes each. Already sent 10 chunks? Resend the first chunk, then the second, etc. This smooths out the total number of bytes sent, keeping individual message sizes small and uniform. And often, loss of messages is handled. If chunk 1 was lost, just wait for it to be resent. But it runs into an issue with message loss - if chunk 99 was lost, the receiver has to wait for all of chunks 1-98 to be resent before it receives the chunk it missed. More importantly, if a malicious middleman wants to stop keys from being decided upon, they could always drop chunk 3, never allowing the full key to pass between the two parties.We can get around all of these issues using a concept called erasure codes. Erasure codes work by breaking up a larger message into smaller chunks, then sending those along. Let’s consider our 1000 byte message being sent as 100 byte chunks again. After chunk #10 has been sent, the entirety of the original 1000 byte message has been sent along in cleartext. But rather than just send the first chunk over again, erasure codes build up a new chunk #11, and #12, etc. And they build them in such a way that, once the recipient receives any 10 chunks in any order, they’ll be able to reconstruct the original 1000 byte message.When we put this concept of erasure code chunks together with our previous state machine, it gives us a way to send large blocks of data in small chunks, while handling messages that are dropped. Crucially, this includes messages dropped by a malicious middleman: since any N chunks can be used to recreate the original message, a bad actor would need to drop all messages after #N-1 to disallow the data to go through, forcing them into a complete (and highly noticeable) denial of service. Now, if Alice wants to send an EK to Bob, Alice will:Transition from the StartingA state to the SendingEK state, by generating a new EK and chunking itWhile in the SendingEK state, send a new chunk of the EK along with any messages she sendsWhen she receives confirmation that the recipient has received the EK (when she receives a chunk of CT), transition to the ReceivingCT stateTransition from the StartingB state to the ReceivingEK state when he receives its first EK chunkKeep receiving EK chunks until he has enough to reconstruct the EKAt that point, reconstruct the EK, generate the CT, chunk the CT, and transition to the SendingCT stateFrom this point on, he will send a chunk of the CT with every messageOne interesting way of looking at this protocol so far is to consider the messages flowing from Alice to Bob as potential capacity for sending data associated with post-quantum ratcheting: each message that we send, we could also send additional data like a chunk of EK or of the CT. If we look at Bob’s side, above, we notice that sometimes he’s using that capacity (IE: in step 4 when he’s sending CT chunks) and sometimes he’s not (if he sends a message to Alice during step 2, he has no additional data to send). This capacity is pretty limited, so using more of it gives us the potential to speed up our protocol and agree on new secrets more frequently.A Meditation On How Faster Isn’t Always BetterWe want to generate shared secrets, then use them to secure messages. So, does that mean that we want to generate shared secrets as fast as possible? Let’s introduce a new term: an epoch. Alice and Bob start their sessions in epoch 0, sending the EKs for epoch 1 (EK#1) and associated ciphertext (CT#1) to each other. Once that process completes, they have a new shared secret they use to enter epoch 1, after which all newly sent messages are protected by the new secret. Each time they generate a new shared secret, they use it to enter a new epoch. Surely, every time we enter a new epoch with a new shared secret, we protect messages before that secret (FS) and after that secret (PCS), so faster generation is better? It seems simple, but there’s an interesting complexity here that deserves attention.First, let’s discuss how to do things faster. Right now, there’s a lot of capacity we’re not using: Bob sends nothing while Alice sends an EK, and Alice sends nothing while Bob sends a CT. Speeding this up isn’t actually that hard. Let’s change things so that Alice sends EK#1, and once Bob acknowledges its receipt, Alice immediately generates and sends EK#2. And once she notices Bob has received that, she generates and sends EK#3, etc. Whenever Alice sends a new message, she always has data to send along with it (new EK chunks), so she’s using its full capacity. Bob doesn’t always have a new CT to send, but he is receiving EKs as fast as Alice can send them, so he often has a new CT to send along.But now let’s consider what happens when an attacker gains access to Alice. Let’s say that Alice has sent EK#1 and EK#2 to Bob, and she’s in the process of sending EK#3. Bob has acknowledged receipt of EK#1 and EK#2, but he’s still in the process of sending CT#1, since in this case Bob sends fewer messages to Alice than vice versa. Because Alice has already generated 3 EKs she hasn’t used, Alice needs to keep the associated DK#1, DK#2, and DK#3 around. So, if at this point someone maliciously gains control of Alice’s device, they gain access to both the secrets associated with the current epoch (here, epoch 0) and to the DKs necessary to reconstruct the secrets to other epochs (here, epochs 1, 2, and 3) using only the over-the-wire CT that Bob has yet to send. This is a big problem: by generating secrets early, we’ve actually made the in-progress epochs and any messages that will be sent within them less secure against this single-point-in-time breach.To test this out, we at Signal built a number of different state machines, each sending different sets of data either in parallel or serially. We then ran these state machines in numerous simulations, varying things like the ratio of messages sent by Alice vs Bob, the amount of data loss or reordering, etc. And while running these simulations, we tracked what epochs’ secrets were exposed at any point in time, assuming an attacker were to breach either Alice’s or Bob’s secret store. The results showed that, in general, while simulations that handled multiple epochs’ secrets in parallel (IE: by sending EK#2 before receipt of CT#1) did generate new epochs more quickly, they actually made more messages vulnerable to a single breach.But Let’s Still Be EfficientThis still leaves us with a problem, though: the capacity present in messages we send in either direction is still a precious resource, and we want to use it as efficiently as possible. And our simple approach of Alice’s “send EK, receive CT, repeat” and Bob’s “receive EK, send CT, repeat” leaves lots of time where Alice and Bob have nothing to send, should that capacity be available.To improve our use of our sending capacity, we decided to take a harder look into the ML-KEM algorithm we’re using to share secrets, to see if there was room to improve. Let’s break things down more and share some actual specifics on the ML-KEM algorithm.Alice generates an EK of 1184 bytes to send to Bob, and an associated DKBob samples a new shared secret (32 bytes), which he encrypts with EK into a CT of 1088 bytes to send to AliceAlice receives the CT, uses the DK to decrypt it, and now also has access to the 32 byte shared secretDiving in further, we can break out step #3 into some sub-stepsAlice generates an EK of 1184 bytes to send to Bob, and an associated DKBob samples a new shared secret (32 bytes), which he encrypts with EK into a CT of 1088 bytes to send to Alice Bob creates a new shared secret S and sampled randomness R by sampling entropy and combining it with a hash of EKBob hashes the EK into a HashBob pulls 32 bytes of the EK, a SeedBob uses the Seed and R to generate the majority of the CTBob then uses S and EK to generate the last portion of the CTAlice receives the CT, uses the DK to decrypt it, and now also has access to the 32 byte shared secretStep 3.d, which generates 960 bytes of the 1088-byte CT, only needs 64 bytes of input: a Seed that’s 32 of EK’s bytes, and the hash of EK, which is an additional 32. If we combine these values and send them first, then most of EK and most of the CT can be sent in parallel from Alice to Bob and Bob to Alice respectively. Our more complicated but more efficient secret sharing now looks like this:Alice generates EK and DK. Alice extracts the 32-byte Seed from EKAlice sends 64 bytes EK (Seed + Hash(EK)) to Bob. Bob sends nothing during this time.Bob receives the Seed and Hash, and generates the first, largest part of the CT from them (CT)After this point, Alice sends EK (the rest of the EK minus the Seed), while Bob sends CTBob eventually receives EK, and uses it to generate the final portion of the CT (CT)Once Alice tells Bob that she has received all of CT, Bob sends Alice CT. Alice sends nothing during this time.With both sides having all of the pieces of EK and the CT that they need, they extract their shared secret and increment their epochThere are still places in this algorithm (specifically steps 2 and 6) where one side has nothing to send. But during those times, the other side has only a very small amount of information to send, so the duration of those steps is minimal compared to the rest of the process. Specifically, while the full EK is 37 chunks and the full CT is 34, the two pieces of the new protocol which must be sent without data being received (EK and CT) are 2 and 4 chunks respectively, while the pieces that can be sent while also receiving (EK and CT) are the bulk of the data, at 36 and 30 chunks respectively. Far more of our sending capacity is actually used with this approach.Remember that all of this is just to perform a quantum-safe key exchange that gives us a secret we can mix into the bigger protocol. To help us organize our code, our security proofs, and our understanding better we treat this process as a standalone protocol that we call the ML-KEM Braid.This work was greatly aided by the authors of the libcrux-ml-kem Rust library, who graciously exposed the APIs necessary to work with this incremental version of ML-KEM 768. With this approach completed, we’ve been able to really efficiently use the sending capacity of messages sent between two parties to share secrets as quickly as possible without exposing secrets from multiple epochs to potential attackers.Mixing Things Up - The Triple RatchetThere are plenty of details to add to make sure that we reached every corner - check those out in our online protocol documentation - but this basic idea lets us build secure messaging that has post-quantum FS and PCS without using up anyone’s data. We’re not done, though! Remember, at the beginning of this post we said we wanted post-quantum security without taking away our existing guarantees.While today’s Double Ratchet may not be quantum safe, it provides a high level of security today and we believe it will continue to be strong well into the future. We aren’t going to take that away from our users. So what can we do?Our answer ends up being really simple: we run both the Double Ratchet and the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet alongside each other and mix their keys together, into what we’re calling the Triple Ratchet protocol. When you want to send a message you ask both the Double Ratchet and SPQR “What encryption key should I use for the next message?” and they will both give you a key (along with some other data you need to put in a message header). Instead of either key being used directly, both are passed into a Key Derivation Function - a special function that takes random-enough inputs and produces a secure cryptographic key that’s as long as you need. This gives you a new “mixed” key that has hybrid security. An attacker has to break both our elliptic curve and ML-KEM to even be able to distinguish this key from random bits. We use that mixed key to encrypt our message.Receiving messages is just as easy. We take the message header - remember it has some extra data in it - and send it to the Double Ratchet and SPQR and ask them “What key should I use to decrypt a message with this header?” They both return their keys and you feed them both into that Key Derivation Function to get your decryption key. After that, everything proceeds just like it always has.So we’ve got this new, snazzy protocol, and we want to roll it out to all of our users across all of their devices… but none of the devices currently support that protocol. We roll it out to Alice, and Alice tries to talk to Bob, but Alice speaks SPQR and Bob doesn’t. Or we roll it out to Bob, but Alice wants to talk to Bob and Alice doesn’t know the new protocol Bob wants to use. How do we make this work?Let’s talk about the simplest option: allowing downgrades. Alice tries to establish a session with Bob using SPQR and sends a message over it. Bob fails to read the message and establish the session, because Bob hasn’t been upgraded yet. Bob sends Alice an error, so Alice has to try again. This sounds fine, but in practice it’s not tenable. Consider what happens if Alice and Bob aren’t online at the same time… Alice sends a message at 1am, then shuts down. Bob starts up at 3am, sends an error, then shuts down. Alice gets that error when she restarts at 5am, then resends. Bob starts up at 7am and finally gets the message he should have received at 3am, 4 hours behind schedule.To handle this, we designed the SPQR protocol to allow itself to downgrade to not being used. When Alice sends her first message, she attaches the SPQR data she would need to start up negotiation of the protocol. Noticing that downgrades are allowed for this session, Alice doesn’t mix any SPQR key material into the message yet. Bob ignores that data, because it’s in a location he glosses over, but since there’s no mixed in keys yet, he can still decrypt the message. He sends a response that lacks SPQR data (since he doesn’t yet know how to fill it in), which Alice receives. Alice sees a message without SPQR data, and understands that Bob doesn’t speak SPQR yet. So, she downgrades to not using it for that session, and they happily talk without SPQR protection.There’s some scary potential problems here… let’s work through them. First off, can a malicious middleman force a downgrade and disallow Alice and Bob from using SPQR, even if both of them are able to? We protect against that by having the SPQR data attached to the message be MAC’d by the message-wide authentication code - a middleman can’t remove it without altering the whole message in such a way that the other party sees it, even if that other party doesn’t speak SPQR. Second, could some error cause messages to accidentally downgrade sometime later in their lifecycle, due either to bugs in the code or malicious activity? Crucially, SPQR only allows a downgrade when it first receives a message from a remote party. So, Bob can only downgrade if he receives his first message from Alice and notices that she doesn’t support SPQR, and Alice will only downgrade if she receives her first reply from Bob and notices that he doesn’t. After that first back-and-forth, SPQR is locked in and used for the remainder of the session.Finally, those familiar with Signal’s internal workings might note that Signal sessions last a really long time, potentially years. Can we ever say “every session is protected by SPQR”, given that SPQR is only added to new sessions as they’re being initiated? To accomplish this, Signal will eventually (once all clients support the new protocol) roll out a code change that enforces SPQR for all sessions, and that archives all sessions which don’t yet have that protection. After the full rollout of that future update, we’ll be able to confidently assert complete coverage of SPQR.One nice benefit to setting up this “maybe downgrade if the other side doesn’t support things” approach is that it also sets us up for the future: the same mechanisms that allow us to choose between SPQR or no-SPQR are designed to also allow us to upgrade from SPQR to some far-future (as yet unimagined) SPQRv2.Making Sure We Get It RightComplex protocols require extraordinary care. We have to ensure that the new protocol doesn’t lose any of the security guarantees the Double Ratchet gives us. We have to ensure that we actually get the post-quantum protection we’re aiming for. And even then, after we have full confidence in the protocol, we have to make sure that our implementation is correct and robust and stays that way as we maintain it. This is a tall order.To make sure we got this right, we started by building the protocol on a firm foundation of fundamental research. We built on the years of research the academic community has put into secure messaging and we collaborated with researchers from PQShield, AIST, and NYU to explore what was possible with post-quantum secure messaging. In a paper at Eurocrypt 25 we introduced erasure code based chunking and proposed the high-level Triple Ratchet protocol, proving that it gave us the post-quantum security we wanted without taking away any of the security of the classic Double Ratchet. In a follow up paper at USENIX 25, we observed that there are many different ways to design a post-quantum ratchet protocol and we need to pick the one that protects user messages the best. We introduced and analyzed six different protocols and two stood out: one is essentially SPQR, the other is a protocol using a new KEM, called Katana, that we designed just for ratcheting. That second one is exciting, but we want to stick to standards to start!As we kept finding better protocol candidates - and we implemented around a dozen of them - we modeled them in ProVerif to prove that they had the security properties we needed. Rather than wrapping up a protocol design and performing formal verification as a last step we made it a core part of the design process. Now that the design is settled, this gives us machine verified proof that our protocol has the security properties we demand from it. We wrote our Rust code to closely match the ProVerif models, so it is easy to check that we’re modeling what we implement. In particular, ProVerif is very good at reasoning about state machines, which we’re already using, making the mapping from code to model much simpler.We are taking formal verification further than that, though. We are using hax to translate our Rust implementation into F* on every CI run. Once the F* models are extracted, we prove that core parts of our highly optimized implementation are correct, that function pre-conditions and post-conditions cannot be violated, and that the entire crate is panic free. That last one is a big deal. It is great for usability, of course, because nobody wants their app to crash. But it also matters for correctness. We aggressively add assertions about things we believe must be true when the protocol is running correctly - and we crash the app if they are false. With hax and F*, we prove that those assertions will never fail.Often when people think about formally verified protocol implementations, they imagine a one-time huge investment in verification that leaves you with a codebase frozen in time. This is not the case here. We re-run formal verification in our CI pipeline every time a developer pushes a change to GitHub. If the proofs fail then the build fails, and the developer needs to fix it. In our experience so far, this is usually as simple as adding a pre- or postcondition or returning an error when a value is out of bounds. For us, formal verification is a dynamic part of the development process and ensures that the quality is high on every merge.Signal is rolling out a new version of the Signal Protocol with the Triple Ratchet. It adds the Sparse Post-Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR, to the existing Double Ratchet to create a new Triple Ratchet which gives our users quantum-safe messaging without taking away any of our existing security promises. It’s being added in such a way that it can be rolled out without disruption. It’s relatively lightweight, not using much additional bandwidth for each message, to keep network costs low for our users. It’s resistant to meddling by malicious middlemen - to disrupt it, all messages after a certain time must be dropped, causing a noticeable denial of service for users. We’re rolling it out slowly and carefully now, but in such a way that we’ll eventually be able to say with confidence “every message sent by Signal is protected by this.” Its code has been formally verified, and will continue to be so even as future updates affect the protocol. It’s the combined effort of Signal employees and external researchers and contributors, and it’s only possible due to the continued work and diligence of the larger crypto community. And as a user of Signal, our biggest hope is that you never even notice or care. Except one day, when headlines scream “OMG, quantum computers are here”, you can look back on this blog post and say “oh, I guess I don’t have to care about that, because it’s already been handled”, as you sip your Nutri-Algae while your self-driving flying car wends its way through the floating tenements of Megapolis Prime.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>qbecc is a C compiler producing Go ABI0 assembler</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nw7xmk/qbecc_is_a_c_compiler_producing_go_abi0_assembler/</link><author>/u/0xjnml</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 16:05:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The resulting assembler code runs on standard Go movable stacks.

As the Hindu nationalist RSS movement marks its centenary, DW explores how it’s become one of India’s most influential and controversial organizations.

India is at a crossroads. Gandhi’s vision of secularism, once central to the republic’s identity, is increasingly challenged by religion-based nationalism. At the heart of this shift is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — a large network with millions of followers. The RSS presents itself as the guardian of Hindu values, while critics widely classify it as a paramilitary organization. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has deep roots in the RSS, its influence reaches to the highest levels of political power. 
 
The documentary follows families, activists, and eyewitnesses who have been profoundly influenced by the RSS across generations, as well as those negatively impacted by its ideology. It reveals how the RSS, through discipline, rituals, and targeted youth training, is moulding a new generation for whom "Hindutva" — the idea of a Hindu nation — is becoming a lived reality. At the same time, religious minorities and interfaith couples face increasing social pressures and uncertainty.  

Founded in 1925 by K. B. Hedgewar, the early ideological figures of the RSS — most notably M. S. Golwalkar — engaged with European nationalist thinking at a time when fascist regimes were gaining ground. While they did not adopt these ideologies wholesale, aspects of the organizational models employed by Mussolini and Hitler appear to have informed the movement’s structure and strategies. 

As the RSS marks its 100th anniversary, its enduring and growing influence raises pressing questions: What remains of Gandhi’s vision for a pluralistic India? Where is the country heading?  And who does India belong to?

Through historical insight, personal narratives, and exclusive interviews, the film traces a nation at a crossroads — between tradition and modernity, inclusion and exclusion.

AI consciousness, its possibility or probability, has burst into public debate, eliciting all kinds of issues from AI ethics and rights to AI going rogue and harming humanity. We explore diverse views; we argue that AI consciousness depends on theories of consciousness.

Forget everything you thought you knew about Jupiter's core. Scientists long debated whether our solar system's largest planet had a dense, solid heart, or no core at all. But now, data from NASA’s Juno probe has revealed an answer no one expected: the core is ‘fuzzy’. This massive discovery completely upends all our current theories on how Jupiter, and every other gas giant, formed and evolved. Join us as we explore the data that changed everything.

When the Visualphone VP210 hit the market in 1999, it advertised a never-before-seen feature: a camera. With only .11 megapixels, the Visualphone is a relic compared to modern devices. But while this technology has improved dramatically, engineers are rapidly approaching a hard limit on phone camera quality. So, what's limiting them? Rachel Yang shares a snapshot of how digital cameras work.

The company’s product-market fit seems so obvious now but, once upon a time, multiple investors shrugged the idea off, insisting that “no one would want to stay in a stranger’s home.”Or take Netflix. The streaming giant once begged Blockbuster to buy them for $50 million. Blockbuster laughed them out of the room. Fast-forward a decade, and Netflix became the company that disrupted Blockbuster into extinction.If there’s a pattern in these stories, it’s that being ignored is often the first chapter in a startup’s story. So don’t beat yourself up for being overlooked at first. However, eventually, the right people must discover and champion your cause if you’re going to scale.Why do Good Startups Get Ignored?Short answer: The Validation GapThis is the space between a Startup having a viable product and the outside world (investors, customers, press, or partners)  it’s viable.You know your startup lives in this space when:You have early traction, but no one outside your bubble knows or cares.The customers you’ve painstakingly acquired love you, but investors aren’t buying it.You’re “real” to you and your users, but “invisible” to the broader market.I can hazard a guess as to what your next question is:Why does the validation gap exist? Ideas come to us all, and thousands of founders turn them into startups every month. Without strong validation, yours may never rise above the noise.Lack of backing from a trustworthy third party: Most investors won’t care about your product/service until other trustworthy people or establishments tell them that they need to. This is self-explanatory. If you’re not publishing stories, data, or insights, you simply don’t exist online. Metrics are great, but a narrative that communicates momentum and credibility is even better.The Validation Gap is a tricky, sunken place.\
But it’s not a death sentence for your business. Here’s how to close it.How to Close the Validation GapConsistently Publish Your Story (Somewhere People Will Actually Read it)Your company blog is a great start. But, if we’re being honest, most of the time, only your employees and a handful of early customers actually read it. To really put yourself out there, you need to publish where a large, tech-curious audience already hangs out.There are plenty of platforms out there, but with over 4 million monthly readers and a constantly updated library of tech-focused insights, HackerNoon is one of the best places to share your story with the world.Collect Third-Party Validation Like Infinity StonesValidation creates a flywheel: once one respected outlet, award, or community signals your value, others follow. Apply for awards. Enter contests. Even  recognitions are powerful credibility boosts. This is something we understand all too well. The latest edition of our Startups award,  recorded over 4.3 million votes to crown top startups in over 100 industries and regions.One of our Startups of The Year, , took things a step further by partnering with HackerNoon to launch the inaugural  which has since then brought in hundreds of stories from writers who interacted with the company enough to write about it.Influencer marketing Startups like  also demonstrate this principle well. They built traction by amplifying authentic creator voices across multiple networks, letting others validate them publicly. It’s a reminder that credibility spreads faster when it’s shared by communities, not just self-declared by founders.Be Loud About Every Milestone & Expand Your DistributionSome founders bury their best traction in pitch decks. Don’t. Every milestone—first 100 users, first paying customers, product launch, R&D breakthroughs, everything—is a story worth telling. And you need to tell it everywhere you can.Publish consistently, then repurpose for different audiences: turn an article into a video essay for YouTube, break it down into bite-sized posts for text-first platforms like X, or adapt it into visuals for Instagram and LinkedIn. The more formats you use, the further your story travels.Do it all with HackerNoonThe Validation Gap is where most good startups stumble. That’s why we created a special Business Blogging package for startups, designed to help you share your story with a dedicated audience of technologists, investors, and builders who care. to your website (yes, including CTAs)A personalized Tech Company News Page featuring your logo, intro, call-to-action, and socials.

            French police have arrested the captain and first officer of a sanctioned tanker suspected of operating for Russia’s “shadow fleet,” after the navy boarded the vessel, authorities said on Thursday.
    
            “Thanks to our Navy commandos and to the crews of the French Navy who intervened this weekend on board a Russian shadow fleet tanker, currently anchored off Saint-Nazaire,” Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu wrote on X.
    
            “Their action contributed to the arrest of two members of its crew.”
    
            Brest Prosecutor Stephane Kellenberger, whose office is handling the investigation into the Boracay, said in a statement the two people in custody had identified themselves as the ship’s captain and its first officer.
    
            They are accused of failing to provide proof of the vessel’s nationality and failing to comply with orders, and their detention has been extended, he said.
    
            Although President Emmanuel Macron has welcomed the probe into the vessel, estimating that Russia’s “shadow fleet” contains 600 to 1,000 ships, French authorities have been tight-lipped about the investigation.
    
            The Boracay, which has been sanctioned by Britain and the European Union, left the Russian port of Primorsk on September 20, according to MarineTraffic data.
    
            It was approximately 50 nautical miles (90 km) south of Copenhagen, heading out of the Baltic Sea, when drone activity forced the closure of the city’s airport around 18:30 GMT on September 22, according to MarineTraffic’s data.
    
            It was also observed traveling south along Denmark’s western coast on the evening of September 24, when drones were reported flying north of Esbjerg and near several nearby airports.
    
            French and Danish authorities have declined to comment on whether the French probe is related to the drone incursions.
    
            The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had no information about the vessel but added that the Russian military had to act sometimes to restore order when foreign countries had taken what spokesman Dmitry Peskov described as “provocative actions.”

As British Jews across the UK attended synagogue this morning for the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, many found out that there had been an attack outside a synagogue in Manchester. The horror filtered across the synagogue in whispers. It is a day of fasting, reflection and prayer, when Jewish people believe it is the day that sets how their year will go. The words used in one of the most significant prayers on this day: “on Yom Kippur it is sealed... who will live and who will die”. Today, terror came to British Jews at their synagogue, and many absolutely fear for their safety. Security is already mandatory for synagogues, Jewish schools and community centres, but it is unable to fully keep out the hate.Jewish people greet each other on Yom Kippur with a phrase in Hebrew "G’mar Chatima Tovah". It’s interpreted as "may you have a good and final sealing in the book of life".Two Jewish people in Britain lost their lives today and for the community here, some who over generations fled persecution to these shores, who always viewed Britain as a safe haven, but have been rocked by an increase in antisemitism, nothing will ever feel the same again.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>N8n added native persistent storage with DataTables</title><link>https://community.n8n.io/t/data-tables-are-here/192256</link><author>XCSme</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 14:26:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lost in Chopin?

In recent months, Russian drones flew deep into Poland, warplanes violated Estonia’s airspace for 12 minutes and Denmark spotted unidentified drones over its main air force base. President Trump has said that European members of NATO should respond with force.

Signal is considered one of the most secure messengers."If we were faced with the choice of either undermining the integrity of our encryption and our data protection guarantees or leaving Europe, we would unfortunately make the decision to leave the market," Meredith Whittaker told the German Press Agency (dpa). The data protection expert is President of the non-profit Signal Foundation in the USA, which develops Signal.The European Union has been discussing a law for three years that is intended to regulate the fight against depictions of child sexual abuse. The proposal for a corresponding regulation stipulates that messengers such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram and Threema should allow content to be checked before it is encrypted. To this end, the apps would have to include a control mechanism that can check all content."Not only the good guys have access to a backdoor"Whittaker said Signal would never undermine the integrity of its end-to-end encryption. "It guarantees the privacy of millions and millions of people around the world, often in life-threatening situations." This is why Signal rejects chat control. "It's unfortunate that politicians continue to fall prey to a kind of magical thinking that assumes you can create a backdoor that only the good guys can access."In the debate on chat control in the EU, the European Parliament had opposed such plans - with a broad majority across all political camps. In the Council of Member States, on the other hand, there was a majority in favor of chat control. However, without Germany and a few other countries, the plans could not be implemented here either. This could now change under the Danish Council Presidency.Unclear position of the German governmentIt will be important to see how Germany positions itself. The coalition agreement of the black-red federal government states: "We will combat discrimination in the digital space and protect fundamental digital rights. In principle, we will safeguard the confidentiality of private communication and anonymity online." However, the word "in principle" indicates that exceptions to this principle may be permitted. Critics fear that this will also make it possible to install backdoors in WhatsApp, Signal and co.Signal CEO Whittaker said that in the worst case scenario, they would work with partners and the community to see if they could find ways to circumvent these rules. Signal also did this when the app was blocked in Russia or Iran. "But ultimately, we would leave the market before we had to comply with dangerous laws like these."Warning about the AI agentsIn the interview with dpa, Whittaker also warned against the use of so-called AI agents, i.e. software robots with artificial intelligence that travel the internet on behalf of the user and independently take care of things such as booking a table in a restaurant or coordinating appointments with friends. "These AI agents require enormous access options and almost unlimited authorizations. This gives them access to important applications and services - from the calendar to the email account, the Signal app or the credit card."In order for apps such as Signal to be able to effectively defend themselves against spying, the manufacturers of the operating systems for computers and cell phones - i.e. Microsoft with Windows, Google with Android and Apple especially with iOS for the iPhone - now have a duty. They would have to set up an objection option against AI agents at developer level.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Potential issues in curl found using AI assisted tools</title><link>https://mastodon.social/@bagder/115241241075258997</link><author>robhlam</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 13:29:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why are we still talking about containers?

Two crew members were detained.Moscow uses the fleet of tankers to evade sanctions on Russian oil. The Kremlin is also using the fleet to "launch and control" Russian drones over European cities, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 28, citing intelligence reports.The suspected ship, known as the Boracay, has changed its name several times and departed from Primorsk near Russia's St. Petersburg on Sept. 20. The vessel was en route to India carrying 750,000 barrels of oil.The ship was spotted near Denmark a week prior under its former name, Pushpa, the Guardian reported.Unidentified drones prompted airport closures several times in Denmark last week. As investigations continue, Danish authorities have not ruled out that the drones may be Russian.An investigation of the Boracay is taking place following the crew's "failure to justify the nationality of the vessel" and "refusal to cooperate," French authorities said.In April, the ship was registered as the Kiwala, and in 2024, the vessel was known as the Varuna, the Guardian reported.Several other cargo ships have been suspected of launching the Russian drones, Danish media reported.In recent days, drones have also caused disruptions in several European countries, including Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands.In response to the airspace violations, Ukrainian military specialists have arrived in Denmark to take part in joint counter-drone exercises, officials said Sept. 29.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.18 Kbuild Brings An Optimization For gen_init_cpio On Btrfs Or XFS</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.18-Kbuild</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 13:17:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Kbuild changes have been merged for the in-development Linux 6.18 kernel...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ivan the Terrible and his Son Ivan by Ilya Repin: Great Art Explained</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXOlTjObWTw</link><author>Great Art Explained</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YXOlTjObWTw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 13:01:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCePDFpCr78_qmVtpoB1Axaw">Great Art Explained</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[My book Great Art Explained is ready to pre-order now worldwide

Ilya Repin's Ivan the Terrible and his Son Ivan, is one of the most controversial and shocking images in Russian art. 
When it was unveiled in 1885, it caused such a scandal that the Tsar himself banned it from public view.
Since then, it has been physically attacked twice - slashed in 1913 and nearly destroyed again in 2018. To this day, Russian nationalists denounce it, insisting it is Western propaganda, historically inaccurate, and unfair to Ivan the Terrible.
But the painting leaves little room for doubt. Here, Ivan the Terrible - Russia’s first crowned Tsar - has just struck down his own son in a violent rage, moments after attacking his pregnant daughter-in-law and causing her to miscarry.
This isn’t simply a historical scene. It is a universal story of rage, regret, domination, and destruction - an image that still reverberates through time. And is still relevant.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.Elon Musk’s SpaceX has taken money directly from Chinese investors, according to previously sealed testimony, raising new questions about foreign ownership interests in one of the United States’ most important military contractors.The recent testimony, coming from a SpaceX insider during a court case, marks the first time direct Chinese investment in the privately held company has been disclosed. While there is no prohibition on Chinese ownership in U.S. military contractors, such investment is heavily regulated and the issue is treated by the U.S. government as a significant national security concern.“They obviously have Chinese investors to be honest,” Iqbaljit Kahlon, a major SpaceX investor, said in a deposition last year, adding that some are “directly on the cap table.” “Cap table” refers to the company’s capitalization table, which lists its shareholders.Kahlon’s testimony does not reveal the scope of Chinese investment in SpaceX or the identities of the investors. Kahlon has long been close with the company’s leadership and runs his own firm that acts as a middleman for wealthy investors looking to buy shares of SpaceX.SpaceX keeps its full ownership structure secret. It was previously reported that some Chinese investors had bought indirect stakes in SpaceX, investing in middleman funds that in turn owned shares in the rocket company. The new testimony describes direct investments that suggest a closer relationship with SpaceX.SpaceX has thrived as it snaps up sensitive U.S. government contracts, from building spy satellites for the Pentagon to launching spacecraft for NASA. U.S. embassies and the White House have connected to the company’s Starlink internet service too. Musk’s roughly 42% stake in the company is worth an estimated $168 billion. If he owned nothing else, he’d be one of the 10 richest people in the world.National security law experts said federal officials would likely be deeply interested in understanding the direct Chinese investment in SpaceX. Whether there was cause for concern would depend on the details, they said, but the U.S. government has asserted that China has a systematic strategy of using investments in sensitive industries to conduct espionage.If the investors got access to nonpublic information about the company — say, details on its contracts or supply chain — it could be useful to Chinese intelligence, said Sarah Bauerle Danzman, an Indiana University professor who has worked for the State Department scrutinizing foreign investments. That “would create huge risks that, if realized, would have huge consequences for national security,” she said.SpaceX did not respond to questions for this story. Kahlon declined to comment.The new court records come from litigation in Delaware between Kahlon and another investor. The testimony was sealed until ProPublica, with the assistance of lawyers at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the law firm Shaw Keller, moved in the spring to make it public. SpaceX fought the effort, but a judge ruled that some of the records must be released. Kahlon’s testimony was publicly filed this week.Buying shares in SpaceX is much more difficult than buying a piece of a publicly traded company like Tesla or Microsoft. SpaceX has control over who can buy stakes in it, and the company’s investors fall into different categories. The most rarefied group is the direct investors, who actually own SpaceX shares. This group includes funds led by Kahlon, Peter Thiel and a handful of other venture capitalists with personal ties to Musk. Then there are the indirect investors, who effectively buy stakes in SpaceX through a middleman like Kahlon. (The indirect investors are actually buying into a fund run by the middleman, typically paying a hefty fee.) All previously known Chinese investors in SpaceX fell into the latter category.This year, ProPublica reported on an unusual feature of SpaceX’s approach to investment from China. According to testimony from the Delaware case, the company allows Chinese investors to buy stakes in SpaceX so long as the money is routed through the Cayman Islands or other offshore secrecy hubs. Companies only have to proactively report Chinese investments to the government in limited circumstances, and there aren’t hard and fast rules for how much is too much.After ProPublica’s report, House Democrats sent a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth raising alarms about the company’s “potential obfuscation.” “In light of the extreme sensitivity of SpaceX’s work for DoD and NASA, this lack of transparency raises serious questions,” they wrote. It’s unclear if any action was taken in response.Kahlon has turned his access to SpaceX stock into a lucrative business. His investor list reads like an atlas of the world. The investors’ names are redacted in the recently unsealed document, but their addresses span from Chile to Malaysia. One is in Russia. At least two are in mainland China. One is in Qatar. (In one email to SpaceX’s chief financial officer, Kahlon said a Los Angeles-based fund had money from the Qatari royal family and was already invested in SpaceX.)“You made a big fortune,” a China-based financier wrote to Kahlon four years ago. “Lol something like that. SpaceX has been the gift that keeps on giving,” Kahlon responded. “All thanks to you.”Kahlon first met with SpaceX when it was a fledgling startup, according to court records. SpaceX’s CFO, Bret Johnsen, who’s been there for 14 years, testified that Kahlon “has been with the company in one form or fashion longer than I have.” Johnsen also testified that SpaceX has no formal policy about accepting investments from countries deemed adversaries by the U.S. government. But he said he asks fund managers to “stay away from Russian, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean ownership interest” because that could make it “more challenging to win government contracts.”There are indications that by 2021, Kahlon was wary of raising funds from China. The U.S. government had grown increasingly concerned about Chinese investments in tech companies, and that June, Kahlon told an associate he was “being picky” with who he’d let buy into a new SpaceX opportunity. “Only people I want to have a relationship with long term. No one from mainland China,” Kahlon said.But as he raced to assemble a pool of investors, those concerns appeared to fade away. By November 2021, Kahlon was personally raising money from China to buy SpaceX stakes. He told a Shanghai-based company that if it invested with him, it would get quarterly updates on SpaceX’s business development, “visits to SpaceX, and the opportunities to interview with Space X’s CFO,” court records show.Do you have any information we should know about Elon Musk’s businesses?

A great example of this is the sync package, which helps synchronize concurrent routines. In this post, we’ll dive into everything this package has to offer.Waitgroups are used to coordinate the execution of multiple routines. They make it easy to create and ensure that all sub-routines will finish before the main routine ends. In the post about waitgroups I explain better how they work and what changed with Go version 1.25.Mutex stands for mutual exclusion locker. Its function is to lock access to a resource while an operation is being executed, preventing other routines from trying to write to that resource at the same time. For example, what is the return of the following function?If your answer was 1000, there’s a chance you might have gotten it right, but it’s unlikely. This happens because, as routines are executed concurrently, they might try to write to the resource at the same time. To ensure this doesn’t happen, simply add a mutex and lock access to that resource.Usage is quite simple: to lock access to a record you use the  function, and when finished, just use . You just need to be careful not to fall into deadlock. There’s also the  function, which validates whether an active lock exists or not, but its use case is rarer.The RW Mutex is an evolution of the mutex where there are specific locks for writing and reading. This distinction is quite useful when one or more routines need to access a resource for reading only, but don’t want the object to be modified during its execution. However, it’s important to mention that writing has higher priority than reading, and thus, Go avoids starvation.In the example above, we can have several routines calling  to get the average of the integer list. However, if a routine decides to insert another value, everyone will have to wait for that write to finish.The atomic is a subpackage of the sync package that implements concurrency support for primitive types. Currently, it supports the following types: , , , , , , , and . With it, we can simplify the example used in the mutex:It’s necessary to note that basic operations, such as addition, have been re-implemented to ensure that routines do not contend for the resource.The  is like any other normal . It provides functions to compare, swap, assign or retrieve values, with the difference that it is safe for concurrency.The documentation itself suggests it should be used in two cases:When a key is written only once, but read multiple times. An example is a cache that only grows.When multiple goroutines read and write distinct groups of keys.Any other case is better to use the traditional map with mutexes.The  type guarantees that something will be executed only once, even if multiple routines try to execute it. An example of this could be resource initialization, as demonstrated by the Go documentation.It’s important to note that if the function panics, it will not be re-executed.As the name suggests,  works based on a conditional, meaning that when something happens, it releases the execution of a routine. This execution can be released one by one using the  function or activating all at once with .First, we initialize a  with some , an interface that implements the  and  functions. In the example, we use a mutex. When initializing each goroutine, it’s necessary to ensure the lock and then we put it in a waiting state with , which releases the lock, allowing new routines to be started. When a routine is released with  or ,  acquires the  again and releases the code execution. Go’s documentation recommends that  happens inside a loop waiting for a condition, because  alone can’t tell if something has happened or not, but this is not strictly necessary. The general flow then is:goroutine acquires the lock →  →  →  →  →  →  → goroutine releases the lockThe  provides a way to deal with short-lived objects in memory. This helps relieve pressure on the GC, as memory space is always reused. The official documentation cites the  package as an example, which uses pools as temporary output buffers that adjust their size as needed.To initialize a  we need to define its initialization function. When using  we retrieve what is saved in memory and with  we write a new value to it.  is only used if there is nothing allocated into the memory.The  package provides several functionalities that are extremely useful when working with multiple goroutines. It’s possible to control execution with  and  types.  ensure everything will be executed. , , and atomic types prevent resource contention. Finally,  relieves the GC’s work when it’s possible to work with short-lived objects in memory. Without a doubt, this package is crucial for anyone working with goroutines. If you wish to understand the implementation details of this package, I recommend watching the talk presented at Gophercon UK 2025, Deep dive into the sync package by Jesus Hawthorn. There is also a talk that I presented at Golang SP about it. Tell me in the comments if you have already used this package and if it helped you in any way. If you haven’t used it yet, comment on what you thought of the post.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Manchester synagogue attack: Two killed and suspect shot ‘dead’ on Yom Kippur</title><link>https://news.sky.com/story/stabbing-reported-at-a-synagogue-in-manchester-13442669</link><author>/u/Bar1201</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 12:02:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The terrorist who killed two men outside a synagogue on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar is believed to be a British citizen of Syrian descent.Greater Manchester Police have named the suspect as Jihad al Shamie, a 35-year-old who is understood to have entered the UK as a young child. He was granted British citizenship in 2006.Three people - two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s - have been arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.Al Shamie allegedly drove a car towards the gates of the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue and then began attacking people with a knife.He was stopped from getting inside by security staff and members of the congregation. Police shot him dead minutes later, fearing that he was wearing a suicide device.Three men remain in a serious condition in hospital. One suffered a stab wound, a second was hurt after being hit by the car, and the third has an injury possibly "sustained as officers stopped the attacker".Detectives were still at two locations linked to the arrests on last night: White House Avenue in Crumpsall, and Langley Crescent in Prestwich."The second he got out of the car, he started stabbing anyone near him," witness Chava Lewin said."He went for the security guard and tried to break into the synagogue."Police said it appeared al Shamie hadn't been flagged up via the Prevent anti-terror and de-radicalisation programme.The first calls were received at 9.31am and minutes later "Plato" was declared - the codeword used by emergency services for a "marauding terror attack".Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player'He's trying to press a button'Video showed police pointing guns at the attacker as another person lies bloodied and motionless near the synagogue's gates."He's trying to press a button," says the man filming. "Shoot him!"As the attacker tries to get to his feet, a single shot is heard. Police said he was killed seven minutes after the first emergency call.Bomb disposal experts later probed the body and a SAS helicopter flew nearby - but the object worn by the attacker was judged to be "not viable".Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerChief Constable Sir Stephen Watson said there were a lot of people inside the synagogue when the attacker struck."Thanks to the immediate bravery of security staff and the worshippers inside, as well as the fast response of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access," he said.Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video playerPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who returned early from a meeting in Denmark, said Britain must defeat rising anti-Jewish hate."I express my solidarity, but also my sadness that you still have to live with these fears," said Sir Keir."Nobody should have to do that. Nobody. And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community."Yom Kippur is the holiest day of the Jewish year.It is a solemn day of observance and atonement, and marks the peak of the High Holidays.It comes after Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, with both occasions bookmarking the Ten Days of Repentance.Jews observe Yom Kippur by prayer and fasting from sunset the day before to the sunset of the day itself. No work is permitted, and for some, the day is spent at a synagogue.The occasion falls on the 10th day of Tishrei - a Hebrew month between late September and early October.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood visited the area, and said the government would do "whatever is required to keep our Jewish community safe".Members of the Royal Family also reacted to the attack.Enable CookiesAllow Cookies OnceThe King said he and the Queen were "deeply shocked and saddened"."Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this appalling incident and we greatly appreciate the swift actions of the emergency services," said the monarch.The Prince and Princess of Wales said their thoughts were "with the victims and the families".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi OS Updated Against Debian 13 Trixie</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Raspberry-Pi-OS-Debian-13</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 12:01:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Following the recent Raspberry Pi 500+ launch, the latest Raspberry Pi news is the release of Raspberry Pi OS now re-based against Debian 13 "Trixie" along with some additional changes...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Learning Python Programming • Fabrizio Romano &amp; Naomi Ceder • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi-Kv882umU</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Yi-Kv882umU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 12:01:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club. #GOTOcon #GOTObookclub

This solution make sense when:There are not so many nodes in the system (like 5-9)The latency is predictable8.2 Reducing Timestamp indexIn case the solution use synchronization primitives and there is a guarantee that there won’t be two or more records with the same timestamp, then timestampIndex may be reduced.8.3 bitmap map for public keysTo reduce amount of traffic during replication, the algorithm uses bitmap as replacement for public keys. As all nodes should be aware of all public keys in network, it’s fair to say, that all nodes have the same set of public keys. The bitmap algorithm (for the certain record’s public key):All public keys are sorted in ASC orderThen algorithm iterate over sorted public keys: in case the public key is present in record then algorithm return 1 otherwise 0. Example: there are public keys in network [A, B, C, D], the record includes signatures and public keys for [B, C], then bitmap will look: 0110 in binary form, or 6 in decimal formThis number in decimal is then used instead of public keys during replication processThe decoding happens in the opposite way(1) Egor Zuev (zyev.egor@gmail.com)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia Upgraded Missiles to Bypass Patriot.

			Russia, according to the , may have upgraded its ballistic missiles used in strikes on Ukraine so they can evade the Patriot air defense system. The paper cites Ukrainian and Western sources.
		
			The systems in question are the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile, with a declared range of up to 500 kilometers, and the Kinzhal aero-ballistic missile, capable of hitting targets up to 480 kilometers away.
		
			According to FT’s sources, the missiles initially follow a standard trajectory before abruptly veering off course, executing a steep dive or a series of maneuvers that make interception by Patriot defenses more difficult.
		
			The effectiveness of Ukraine’s air defenses has dropped sharply: while in August 37% of Russian ballistic missiles were intercepted, in September the figure fell to just 6%.
		
			The paper notes that in the summer of 2025 Russia struck at least four drone-production facilities in Kyiv and the surrounding region. Among the targets was a plant manufacturing Turkish Bayraktar drones. That strike, carried out on August 28, saw Russian missiles bypass Ukraine’s air defenses and also damage the buildings of the EU delegation and the British Council located nearby.

For a while, we used goja, which is an excellent pure Go JavaScript engine. But as our use cases grew, we missed some modern JavaScript features, things like full async/await, ES2023 support, and tighter interoperability.That's when QJS was born. Instead of binding to a native C library, QJS embeds the QuickJS (NG fork) runtime inside Go using WebAssembly, running securely under Wazero. This means:A fully sandboxed, memory-safe runtime.Here's a quick benchmark comparison (computing factorial(10) one million times):Please refer to repository for full benchmark details.Full ES2023 compatibility (with modules, async/await, BigInt, etc.).Secure, sandboxed webassembly execution using Wazero.Zero-copy sharing of Go values with JavaScript via ProxyValue.Expose Go functions to JS and JS functions back to Go.The project took inspiration from Wazero and the clever WASM-based design of ncruces/go-sqlite3. Both showed how powerful and clean WASM-backed solutions can be in Go.If you've been looking for a way to run modern JavaScript inside Go without CGO, QJS might suit your needs.I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any feature requests.

If they do it twice, it suggests a habit. But if they do it three times, it’s a communication strategy.Keir Starmer said something rather noticeable in his conference speech. He mocked the politicians who’d told voters that “Brexit lies on the side of that bus, click here for your new country”. That made the ears prick up. It’s the first time in a very long time that the Prime Minister has spoken critically about Brexit.You know he opposes it. He’s a human rights lawyer from north London. But he is usually too straitjacketed by Labour’s electoral strategy to say so publicly. Perhaps it was an accident, then. A slip of the tongue. Perhaps he let his feelings out by mistake and would keep them better concealed in future. Then, moments later, he did it again. The “self-appointed champions of working people”, he said, “lied to this country, unleashed chaos and walked away after Brexit”.Oh. So it wasn’t an accident. It was a habit. Then in an interview with GB News – of all people – he went even further. When we were in the EU, Britain had a returns agreement with the European Union on asylum, he pointed out. Farage “told the country it will make no difference if we left – well, he was wrong about that”. The small boats were therefore “Farage Boats”.That makes it a communication strategy. You don’t do the same thing three times in 24 hours by accident. And that suggests something profound: that the view of Brexit as a failure is now settled. It has ossified into a national consensus, without us ever really realising it was happening. Even the Labour leadership, which is usually petrified of this issue, believes it can safely criticise it.During the Brexit wars, Remainers would ask themselves when people would realise it was a mistake. The moment stubbornly refused to arrive. The value of sterling collapsed. The EU comprehensively out-negotiated us. Our political system fell into chaos. Small businesses went bust. None of it seemed to move the dial.The truth is, people are terrible at owning up to their mistakes. They very rarely admit that they were wrong about something. Instead, they turn into mini-Stalins, expunging their historical record and replacing it with one in which they were always right. People have very poor memories, especially when it comes to their own errors.Take the Iraq War. Nowadays, everyone seems to have been against it. They always knew it would be a disaster. They’d always thought so.But this is not how it felt at the time. Back then, there was broad and animated support for the war. , , , ,  and all supported it. With a combined circulation of 9.4 million, they massively outweighed the three papers opposing the war – the , and  – which had a combined audience of 2.7 million.YouGov conducted 21 polls between March and December 2003, asking whether people supported the war. On average, 54 per cent of Brits thought it was right. Now, that figure has plummeted, with just 23 per cent of people thinking it was right.Fine, so people changed their minds. Well, not quite. That would have involved a degree of honest introspection most people are incapable of. Instead, they simply rearranged the past so that it reflected their newfound view.When YouGov asked people in 2015 what their opinions of war in Iraq were at the time, just 37 per cent said they supported military action, an astonishing drop from the figures at the time. The effect is even more dramatic in the US. At the time of the war, 63 per cent of people backed the invasion. But a few years later, just 38 per cent recalled doing so.Slowly but surely, the same thing seems to be happening with Brexit. There was no one central event, no great moment of epiphany in which the nation realised what an error the whole thing was. But slowly, like rising damp, a sense of disdain, mockery and disappointment has taken over. A settled view has developed, without drama or surprise, without anyone even really noticing that it’s happening.Who on earth could claim that Brexit has been a success? Who could name a single benefit it has provided? Who could look at the promises made before the referendum and treat them with anything but bitter laughter now we know how it turned out?People will find different ways of framing their box-fresh opposition. They’ll say politicians missed the opportunities, or we had bad leadership, or the EU sabotaged us. But the truth is, it was a failure because it was a bad idea. It’s no more complicated than that. Voters were convinced to support a project to give the political class a kicking. In fact, they simply damaged themselves and their livelihoods.None of that really matters anymore. What matters is that an anti-Brexit consensus helps us repair the damage.Labour is not about to commit to rejoining the EU. Of course not. But it is pursuing a plan for a really quite intimate relationship with it: regulatory alignment in many areas, deep co-operation on defence, and now the Chancellor is confidently promoting an extensive youth mobility scheme – something which the party was reticent about supporting just a few months ago.That’ll do for now. But as the consensus grows and Labour becomes more confident in criticising Brexit, the possibilities grow for the kinds of things we can demand in a few years’ time, perhaps in time for the next election. Single market membership, perhaps, or the customs union, or a bespoke arrangement like Switzerland has. Or perhaps even full-blown membership.Brexit was always a terrible mistake. But now, at least, people recognise it. And with that, things might just start to improve.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The architecture behind 99.9999% uptime in erlang</title><link>https://volodymyrpotiichuk.com/blog/articles/the-architecture-behind-99%25-uptime</link><author>/u/NoBarber9673</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 09:39:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hey there, have you ever wondered how to build the most stable application in the world? What characteristics does such an application have, and what architecture styles make it possible? It’s pretty impressive how apps like Discord and WhatsApp can handle millions of concurrent users, while some others struggle with just a few thousand. Today, we’ll take a look at how Erlang makes it possible to handle a massive workload while keeping the system alive and stable.
I believe that the best way to describe something complex is to start from the simple things and then gradually move to the complex ones. So let’s start with a simple example.
Imagine such a wonderful day:
You are driving your Porsche Panamera and decide to call your good friend to chat about the upcoming party.  
Your phone sends a signal to the nearest cell tower.  
The network figures out the best route to reach your friend.  
The system establishes the connection and rings your friend’s phone.  
Once your friend picks up, you both start speaking and having a great time.  
Everything works perfectly… until it doesn’t. While you’re driving, your phone switches to a different cell tower, and suddenly the connection drops.
And it would be great if your broken call didn’t mess up other calls in the network (John on the other line definitely doesn’t want to deal with your issues, right?). Ideally, you’d just retry the call and keep chatting with your bro about the upcoming party.
If we turn this situation into a system design lesson, we can pull out a couple of thoughts about reliable systems:
What you do shouldn’t hurt others in the system. In other words, things should be isolated so they don’t affect each other.  
We need mechanisms to monitor and manage those isolated things in a way that lets the system recover from unexpected failures.  
At first glance, this may seem pretty simple. You can achieve something like this in almost any popular programming language. But the how is very different, and so are the feelings you get while developing and debugging such systems.
Let’s check what the options
Imagine that we are trying to build a Discord. This is a highload system which handles millions of calls simultaneously. We need to provide the best user experience so people do not leave us and go to Microsoft Teams for example.
How would you build such system?
Imagine you as a software engineer started working on the system, and you try to handle all calls in one main loop, like this:
  
At first look, this seems pretty simple and elegant. However, in reality each call has a connection that needs to be handled. If you put all of them into a single synchronous loop, then while that loop is busy handling one call, all the other calls are forced to wait.
Some systems allow you to create OS threads to handle work in parallel on multiple CPU cores. OS threads are small work units managed by the OS kernel that can run in the background so the main thread of the process isn’t blocked. They are scheduled preemptively, which means the OS can pause one thread and run another at any time, even on a single CPU core.
Great! You might think, “Let’s give each call its own thread!”
While this seems like a simple way to run things concurrently, there are serious trade-offs:
All threads in a process share the same memory. When you share the same memory, you can have race conditions when threads trying to work on the same data in parallel:   
To prevent this, you must use the locks to the data, however it would affect how the threads are waiting for each other:
  
See how threads mostly waiting, not working!
Even if you used the locks, there can be a situation when one of the threads put corrupted data in the shared memory and other threads received shared corrupted data. How would you handle such case?
OS threads are really heavy in terms of memory. Each OS thread takes at least 512 KB just to exist, without doing anything. To compute how many “empty” threads you can have, just divide your RAM by the per-thread memory. It will give you amount of calls that you would have on your machine. If your machine has 8GB of available memory - it would be like 8gb / 512kb = 16,384. Huh, that’s not a millions unfortunately…
We need to observe the threads: monitor their status, track failures, and react when something goes wrong. With shared state, how would you detect issues in the system, restart only the affected processes (or all if necessary), and ensure everything keeps running smoothly? Pretty complex, right?
What if we introduce an event-driven architecture, where your server communicates with other I/O systems via asynchronous events:
  

The event loop won’t be blocked by a single task, allowing you to handle thousands of them on demand, step by step. For CPU-heavy tasks you can use threads, which help prevent blocking the main thread. 
This kind of model already shows us why so many modern languages like Node.JS, Python lean toward event-driven design: it’s efficient and helps avoid bottlenecks. But it also leaves open questions - how do you supervise those tasks? How do you recover from failures? How do you keep track of thousands of concurrent jobs without going crazy? Only after asking those questions it becomes clear why Erlang is interesting.
How erlang solves such problems
Erlang is built on top of the BEAM virtual machine. “Virtual” means it runs on top of your operating system and provides abstractions for things like processes, scheduling and message passing.
Processes in virtual machine operate in isolated memory chunks and communicate with each other via messages (see  Actor model). Think of them as people sitting in their own rooms, doing their work and sending emails to communicate (no shared memory). 
The idea behind this design is that each process can fail or succeed independently, and the system can handle millions of them concurrently without affecting the others.
Let’s take a look at the main structure of each process:
Stack – keeps track of function calls.  
Heap – stores the process internal data.  
Mailbox – a message queue that allows the process to receive messages from other processes.  
PCB (Process Control Block) – metadata about the process, used internally by Erlang.  
So if you want to spawn a process in the system, you’re really just creating this minimal internal structure that the BEAM needs: its unique identificator, mailbox, stack, heap, and some metadata. It’s lightweight because the process isn’t created by the OS, there is no system call and no need to touch the kernel. Instead, it’s created inside the BEAM virtual machine itself, which takes care of scheduling and managing all these processes.
In theory, creating an Erlang process takes only 327 words (where word is 4 bytes on 32-bit systems or 8 bytes on 64-bit systems), that’s the raw overhead of its internal structure from the above. Compare that to an OS thread, which usually reserves at least 512 KB (and often up to 8 MB) just for the existence.
If you can spawn millions of processes, the next question is: how do you keep track of them? Erlang gives you not only cheap isolated processes, but also tools to see, monitor and control them while everything is running. 
You can set up relationships between these lightweight processes and define how they should behave if some of them misbehave. This feature is available as a ready-to-use abstraction in the erlang libraries (a set of generic behaviors), but it’s also something you can build on top of the features available in Erlang and extend on your own. 
Imagine you’re setting up call connections on your server. Sometimes network errors happen, and you need to restart the connections until they work properly. In Erlang, with linked processes, you can catch a linked process abnormal activity and take the necessary actions yourself - for example, restart it:
Here we are trying to spawn 10 calls where each can fail with equal probability and if they fail, we want to restart them until they restarted succesfully. Here is a demo:
And when you have such a mechanism, you can start building more complex systems on top of it. You can create a supervision tree, where each process monitors another process using built-in behaviors in Erlang (See https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/supervisor). This way, every process is under control — if something goes wrong, that process can be restarted without affecting the whole system. Plus, you always have a clear picture of what’s going on in your system.
How does virtual machine schedule millions of processes?
To understand how this works, let’s go back to the early days of Erlang. The first two decades of Erlang releases, between 1986 and 2006, it supported using at most one CPU core. This means that only one process could execute at a time on that core. However, they had an ability to execute hundreds of thousands processes very fast without blocking single CPU core with long running tasks. How?
Imagine that you have a queue of waiting processes to be executed:
Create an array of values from 1 to 10000  
In this case we will take those processes one by one in first-in-first-out order (sorted by the date of the scheduling):
We will execute first process - it’s pretty simple operation, and we will take only step to complete it.  
We will execute second process - while we execute it, we see that we make array like , then , then  and so on.
In some moment of time, we will understand that this task takes more operations than we would expect to complete it in one batch. In such case, for example on number 5000, we save the current call stack and step where we stop the execution for current process
and intermidiate data in the process heap, and we move to another process! We don’t want to block our CPU with long running task, so we give the time
for other waiting processes.  
We execute third process - which is also pretty fast.  
We return to process number 2, in our heap we already have array with values from 1 to 3000, and we continue to process our array until we finish
it or again we see that this process tooks a many operations to do, we pause it and give other processes their time slice.  
Let’s check this in action with simple demo code, where we simulate the case from above:
And let’s try to execute it:
  
As you see, all the processes get the time for their execution, and they have not blocked each other while executing long running task. I mentioned this technique earlier with OS threads — it’s called preemptive scheduling. It’s used by schedulers in both the BEAM and the OS, where each scheduler runs on a single CPU core and allocates CPU time to every task waiting to be executed.
In erlang, settings like how many function calls a process can execute before the scheduler switches to another task, along with other configuration, are stored in the Process Control Block I mentioned earlier. You can inspect them using:
That’s basically magic behind the concurrent processes on one CPU core. For you, as user of this system, it may looks like you running parallel execution, but in fact, they are running sequentially giving each other space to complete their work. Worth to add, that starting from May 2006, you can run multiple schedulers with multiple CPU cores. It will execute the code truly in parallel between them.
One of the features I love the most
Have you ever thought you could change a part of your application on the fly without redeploying it? Yeah, it’s like changing the tires on a moving car… but safer. And what if I told you that you can debug server processes, functions, and even add new functions to a running system without any downtime? Erlang lets you do that.
To enable hot code load functionality, Erlang has something called the code server — a process that tracks module states and can keep two versions of the same module in memory. When you load the new version into the memory - processes running the current (old) version will finish their work on that version, while processes started after a new load will run the new version. This way, you can debug and update your system very smoothly without downtime.
Also, there is a concept of  release upgrades and downgrades . Basically, we can specify a rollout strategy for every release so our code doesn’t need to drop connections at all. It’s a pretty big topic because you need to manually show how to transform the state from the old version to the new version, what to do with processes that are currently running, and so on. However, on my opinion, it’s much simpler to use rolling upgrades with node restarts (which is also provides zero downtime).
In Erlang, distribution is built right into the system. Just like you can supervise processes, you can also monitor and use other nodes. Nodes can send messages to each other or call functions remotely using RPC (Remote procedure calls), allowing you to coordinate work, handle failures, and scale across machines.
For example, you can build a cluster of nodes that share the workload via load balancing. If one node goes down, the others can seamlessly take over its tasks. Let’s build a simple load balancer to see how it works.
First of all, we will create a load balancer process responsible for getting a random node from the available list and passing it to the caller:
After that, we will start several nodes manually (on the cloud, this could be done automatically on demand) with specific names like these:
and pass them to our load balancer process as initial argument, so our nodes are aware of each other:
  
We see that our erlang nodes are set up correctly and that we’re ready to route our connections. In the next step, we need to create a  module, which will take the node received from the load balancer and perform a remote procedure call on the selected node:
Now we’re ready to accept connections and observe how the application balances requests across the available nodes:
  
As you can see, our requests are distributed randomly across the available nodes. If one of them fails, erlang detects it, removes it from the node list, and load balancer routes traffic to the remaining healthy nodes.
That was a lot of stuff, right? Erlang gives us so many features that in other languages would require special tooling or extra libraries. It makes communication in the system isolated, distributed, reliable, and fault-tolerant, with the ability to debug and even change code at runtime. It’s no miracle that huge, complex systems can achieve 99.999999% uptime when built with Erlang — it’s the architecture itself that allows developers to build such systems quickly and understandably.

            Israel’s nearly two-year war pushed parts of Gaza into “man-made” famine, according to a report published in August by a United Nations-backed initiative, deepening the Palestinians’ struggle for survival under relentless bombing, mass displacement and the spread of disease.
    
            The report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-backed expert panel that assesses global food insecurity and malnutrition, helped to fuel growing international outcry over Israel’s campaign in Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks –and was cited by some of countries that recently made moves towards formally recognizing a Palestinian state. The IPC forecast that by the end of September nearly a third of Gaza’s total population would face famine conditions, although it has not yet provided an update on that forecast.
    
            In Gaza governorate alone – the largest by population of five in the Gaza Strip – more than half a million people were condemned to a cycle of “starvation, destitution and death,” the IPC added. The Israeli assault on Gaza City, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says is targeting one of Hamas’ “remaining strongholds” has choked relief operations for starving Palestinians, according to rights workers.
    
            Michael Fakhri, the UN’s special rapporteur on the right to food, accused Israel of using hunger “as a weapon against Palestinians,” in violation of international law.
    
            “Israel is using food and aid as a weapon to humiliate, weaken, displace and kill Palestinians in Gaza,” Fakhri told CNN on August 28.
    
            Israel rejected the IPC’s findings, with the Israeli agency that oversees the entry of aid into Gaza claiming the report was“false” and based on “partial, biased” data “originating from Hamas.” Netanyahu slammed the UN-backed report, in a statement from his office, adding that “Israel does not have a policy of starvation.”
    
            Israel has since insisted that it has stepped up the entry of aid into Gaza. But aid agencies say that Israel’s intensification of the war, particularly around Gaza City, has compounded the misery faced by Palestinians. Here is a look, in five charts, at how the situation described by the IPC materialized.
    The IPC projected that famine would spread to Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza and further south, in Khan Younis by the end of September, affecting nearly 641,000 people.
    
            Up to June 2026, at least 132,000 children under the age of five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition, including more than 41,000 severe cases of children at heightened risk of death, the IPC added.
    
            Under the IPC – a five-phase indicator used to measure the severity of food insecurity – a famine can only be declared if three thresholds are met: at least 20% of households face extreme food shortages, the proportion of children assessed as acutely malnourished reaches a certain threshold, and at least two in every 10,000 people die each day from starvation, or from malnutrition and disease.
    
            Israel accused the IPC of lowering the second threshold of acutely malnourished children for a famine declaration, which the IPC has denied.
    
            Researchers use three methods for assessing child malnutrition – either a child’s height and weight, their BMI, or a child’s mid-upper arm circumference, known as MUAC. The IPC used the latter, a metric employed since 2019, to determine that at least 15% of children aged six to 59 months have a mid-upper arm circumference of less than 125mm or edema, the agency told CNN. The thresholds for famine classification are “standard and were not modified for Gaza,” the IPC told CNN, adding that the MUAC metric “is the measurement most frequently available and has strong correlation with mortality outcomes,” and was also used in famine classifications in Sudan and South Sudan this decade.
    
            Human rights advocates say Israel’s destruction of health infrastructure and intensified hostilities have hampered efforts to document the full scope of famine in Gaza.
    
            After more than 700 days of war, 455 Palestinians have died of malnutrition or starvation, including 151 children, the health ministry in Gaza reported on  October 1. One hundred and seventy-seven of the total number have died of malnutrition or starvation since the IPC confirmed famine on August 15, it said.
    
            Israel’s vast web of bureaucratic impediments, including delayed approvals, arduous border checks and the arbitrary rejection of items, throttles the amount of aid that makes it to the other side of the border and sends food costssoaring, the UN and aid agencies say.
    
            After visiting the region in late August, US Senators Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley, both Democrats, warned that Netanyahu’s government was “implementing a plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza of Palestinians” and accused Israel of using food “as a weapon of war.” Israel has denied the allegations.
    
            “The findings from our trip lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Netanyahu government’s war in Gaza has gone far beyond the targeting of Hamas to imposing collective punishment on the Palestinians there, with the goal of making life for them unsustainable,” said the report, published on September 11. “That is why it restricts the delivery of humanitarian assistance.”
    
            Israeli authorities have said trucks “remain uncollected” at the border with Gaza – accusing the UN of failing to coordinate the entry of vehicles into the strip.
    
            But Sam Rose, the acting director of affairs for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza, says Israel – which has near-total jurisdiction over what goods enter and exit Gaza – has controlled “to the calorie” the volume, type and overall flow of food into the enclave. “The system is designed not to function smoothly,” he said.
    
            Israeli authorities “know and analyze each truck that goes into Gaza, the weight and the calories,” a senior official with COGAT, the Israeli agency that controls the entry of aid into the enclave, said in September. According to a COGAT statement published in response to the IPC famine declaration, “analysis of contents of food aid trucks that entered the Gaza Strip reveal that 4,400 calories per person per day entered Gaza since the beginning of August.”
    
            However, as of May, Palestinians were consuming just 1,400 calories per day – or “67 per cent of what a human body needs to survive,” at 2,300 calories, the UN reported in June.
    
            Last October, Israel’s government banned UNRWA from operating in areas under its control, a prohibition that went into effect in January, having accused the agency of failing to stop Hamas’ alleged theft of aid. An internal US government review found no evidence of widespread theft by Hamas of US-funded humanitarian aid in Gaza.
    
            When the trickle of relief does enter the strip, aid workers face intensified hostilities, damaged roads and limited fuel supplies – impeding internal distribution efforts, minimizing viable routes and blocking access to displaced Palestinians, said Rose.
    
            Israel says UN aid makes up only part of the relief that gets into Gaza. A senior COGAT official told a briefing in early September that 27% of the trucks entering Gaza are UN vehicles, claiming it was “a lie” that the UN had brought in 600 aid trucks a day before the war.
    
            “There is no famine in Gaza. Period,” the official said, adding that “Israel and the IDF are trying to strengthen the humanitarian situation in Gaza with partners.”
    
            In May, the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) established a program that now plans to operate up to five distribution sites in the enclave, all but one in southern Gaza – which rely on private military contractors and largely replaced 400 UN-led hubs.
    
            Relief and health workers say these other methods of delivering food in Gaza, including the GHF sites and aid pallet drops from planes, are dehumanizing and inaccessible for many Palestinians, and expose them to injury or death.
    
            At least 1,172 people were killed “near militarized supply sites” between May 27 and September 9, the UN said on September 10, with another 1,084 deaths along convoy supply routes. In August, UN experts called for the immediate closure of GHF-operated sites in Gaza and accused Israeli forces of opening “indiscriminate fire” on people seeking aid there. The advocates warned the hubs are “especially difficult” for women, children, people with disabilities and elderly Palestinians to access.
    
            GHF has defended its work in Gaza and said earlier in September that it was the only organization in Gaza able to deliver food “at scale without interference.” The organization also said that it had “repeatedly sought collaboration with UN agencies and international NGOs to deliver aid side-by-side” but that the UN had “declined those offers.” The Israeli military has acknowledged firing warning shots toward crowds in some instances and denied responsibility for other casualties near aid hubs.
    
            The US and Israel plan to set up 12 additional sites across the enclave, an Israeli official told CNN in August. However, there is no indication that the new sites have been established. In September, GHF said it had sought IDF permission to open sites in northern Gaza but that Israel had not granted the permission.
    
            “With parents injured and their siblings starving, many teenagers and young adults are taking the risk,” Mohammed Khaleel, an American surgeon who was deployed to Gaza earlier this year, told CNN in August.
    
            “We’ve even heard some people report that they will go and accept their fate. Dying from a gunshot may be preferable to dying from starvation,” he added.
    
            Israel’s two-year offensive in Gaza had left just 1.5% of cropland accessible and undamaged as of July 28, according to the UN – largely preventing Palestinians from cultivating produce.
    
            That destruction, coupled with Israel’s fishing ban and intensified assault in the north, has   further limited the sources of food available to hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians.
    
            “It is not by chance that Israel has focused its starvation tactics in northern Gaza,” Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur, said. “They have announced their intent to push people from the north to the south of Gaza… Just as now, the focus of their starvation campaign on Gaza City correlates with their invasion plans.”
    
            The military’s invasion of Gaza City will collapse an “already fragile” aid supply chain, warned Arif Husain, chief economist at the World Food Programme.
    
            Relief agencies need a ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian access, large-scale multi-sector aid, protection of civilians and infrastructure – and restoration of commercial and local food systems – to reverse famine in Gaza, said Husain.
    
            “We are already at the brink. Another escalation – especially in Gaza City – could push the situation into unimaginable catastrophe,” he added. “It will not only result in more deaths but destroy any foundation for future recovery.”

The Dutch Ministry of Defence later released an image showing a white drone silhouette painted below the canopy rail of the aircraft, marking the first confirmed combat kill for a Dutch Lightning II.According to Polish officials, the drones entered Poland around 23:30 local time on 9 September, forcing the closure of Warsaw International, Warsaw Modlin, Rzeszów–Jasionka and Lublin airports. At least four drones were shot down, most by Dutch fighters. Analysts later identified several of the drones as Gerbera-type decoys, apparently designed to test allied defences and disrupt civil aviation.Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans, who visited the Dutch F-35 detachment in Poland days after the incident, praised the professionalism and teamwork involved. “Russia’s reckless aggression continues,” he said. “By stationing F-35s in Poland, the Netherlands is demonstrating its readiness with allies, because NATO’s eastern border is also our security border.” He highlighted not only the role of the pilots, but also the mechanics and ground crews, who ensured the jets were combat-ready.The deployment of Dutch F-35s to Poland began on 1 September and will run until December, with the aircraft tasked to protect NATO airspace and deter further Russian incursions. From December, the Netherlands will also reinforce the mission with Patriot surface-to-air missiles, NASAMS, and counter-drone systems, bolstering Poland’s role as a logistics hub for support to Ukraine.The September drone incursion marked one of the largest airspace violations by Russia since the start of its invasion of Ukraine. Poland invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty in response, warning allies that Russian and Belarusian military activity represented an escalating threat. In the days after the incident, Russia and Belarus staged large-scale joint exercises, while NATO launched Operation Eastern Sentry to strengthen its air defences across the eastern flank.For the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the kill marking underscores both the combat credibility of the F-35 and the country’s willingness to take an active role in Europe’s collective defence. The F-35A, with its advanced sensor fusion and stealth, is optimised for detecting and engaging drones that might evade older radar systems. Dutch officials stressed that its deployment has already proven vital in securing NATO’s skies against Russian provocations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PixiEditor is now available on Flathub</title><link>https://pixieditor.net/blog/2025/10/02/september-status/</link><author>/u/flabbet</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 08:36:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi, hello, and welcome to the September PixiEditor Status update! On today’s menu:New renderer and a story of great failureFlatpak is one of the package managers for Linux, which is designed to be the universal package manager for Linux software, especially GUI apps.Up until now, PixiEditor was distributed via  and  formats. It was suboptimal, as integrating PixiEditor to your Linux desktop required more effort.Flatpak solves that issue. It automatically integrates with your desktop environment and manages updates. So if you are on Linux, give it a try!Due to the nature of PixiEditor, rendering is a  tricky part. Not only does Node Graph allows for arbitrary customizations, shaders and operations, PixiEditor has vector capabilities (rendering crisp vectors on small documents)
and animations.Here’s a quick comparison of new renderer with heavy animationSingle threaded renderingPixiEditor renders on the UI Thread, which means that heavy graphs can lag or even freeze the UI.The logical solution was to make rendering on a separate thread.My little render thread journeyIn short, Render Thread is a thing that runs in the background, independently of the main app and renders graphics at it’s own pace. So whenever the main app requests a new frame,
render thread grabs this request, renders and hands the frame to the main app.And I really wish it was that simple. This will be a little technical, so if you are just interested in new features, feel free to skip it.PixiEditor uses Vulkan and OpenGL for rendering. However, neither Vulkan nor OpenGL is “standalone”, we must first access Avalonia’s GPU context to hook our own rendering. We use Avalonia’s composition renderer to update the UI with rendered stuff.Current renderer performs rendering “on demand”, meaning that each UI control sends a render request with its surface to draw on. It has a few benefits:No additional intermediate surfaces,Out of the box “render only what you see” approachMore error-prone (surfaces might get disposed mid-flight)Potentially rendering the same frame multiple timesIt’s harder to manage renders and perform optimizationsIt’s virtually impossible to make rendering on other threadSo the very first step was to invert the rendering logic, so we have more control over each rendered frame.Refresh request —> UI control surface —> Render to control’s surfaceRefresh request —> Render into intermediate surface —> UI control renders intermediate surfaceHaving one managing system that decides what gets rendered and in what resolution opens up a lot of optimization possibilities.For example if you have Node Graph opened and layer’s panel visible, the renderer will render layer’s preview only once in slightly higher resolution (because node previews are bigger), instead of rendering it twice
in different resolutions.Great, so we have a system that produces bitmaps/surfaces with all previews and frames, that are just grabbed by UI controls to display. So the next logical step is to render these asynchronously.Before I decided to jump into building separate thread solution, I tried better rendering scheduling in the Avalonia’s UI Thread dispatcher. It is still one thread, but any lags should be “spread out” over a few frames.At first it seemed to work really great, playing animations for heavy graphs was smooth and the UI was responsive. Unfortunately, after some time I discovered that manipulating heavy graphs (like moving a layer)
resulted in degraded performance. Rendering a singular layer into the bitmap wasn’t slower than in previous renderer, but scheduler fired less often, so it seemed like it was laggy.The only logical solution left at that time, was to implement separate render thread.Remember the part where I mentioned we use Avalonia’s GPU context and compositor?
Yeah, to get a separate render thread I had to properly synchronize not only access to GPU API, but also render thread’s render loop with Avalonia’s compositor.Well, it was. After many days of freezes, crashes and debugging, it seemed to finally work. I developed it on a test project, but still.Until I ran PixiEditor with it…It worked like a hot mess…Something had to be done, I think the whole rework already took me a full 2 weeks, where one whole week was dedicated to render thread. Shipping renderer that provides worse performance is unacceptable, even
if it’s better in some scenarios.At that point, I already invested so much time into this. I decided to give up separate render thread for now. However the whole point of the rework was to fix freezes and improve the performance.I got my shit together and facts straight.> New rework solves laggy animation performance
> Manipulation performance is degraded due to background scheduler update rate> Can’t I just fire rendering immediately when user manipulates the canvas and do background rendering for animation?5 lines of code and problem solved.It doesn’t completely replace separate thread solution. It still runs on the main thread, but it’s already much better. At least according to my tests.(to any brave soul, if you want to play around render thread solution I made, check the  branch both for  and )GPU chunks and direct viewport renderingThis optimization is quite exciting for me. It’s only related to drawing/painting performance, but it’s been on my mind since the beginning of version 2.0.PixiEditor uses chunks for layers. So instead of storing full resolution layer it only stores chunks that have something in them. For example, if you have a 1024x1024 document, one layer of this document
consists of 4 chunks that are 256x256 each. If you only draw on one chunk, others won’t be stored in memory.This system was developed for version 1.0 and lost its meaning during transition to 2.0. Due to the performance reasons we had to use intermediate, full resolution texture before drawing to the screen.
Which kills any benefits of chunks.Why did it work like that? Well, version 1.0 had CPU-only rendering, and CPU chunks were a leftover from 1.0. I tried making them GPU a while ago, but it had major problems back then.Fortunately, I managed to properly implement GPU chunk textures, which significantly improves rendering performance. Thanks to this, I was able to get rid of intermediate surface and draw the chunks
to the screen directly.Direct screen rendering opens a possibility for another amazing optimization technique called occlusion culling. In the new renderer, PixiEditor will only draw chunks you see on the screen, if you zoom the
viewport, chunks outside the visible area won’t be rendered.Here’s a preview with shrunk visible area to see the effectFurthermore, if you have a document with a graph, that consists of layers only, drawing shouldn’t allocate more memory than amount of chunks required. So creating huge documents by itself won’t cause memory problems for PixiEditor.
Saving .pixi files will also save filled chunks only.Please note that the new renderer is not yet released. It will require some more testing before it lands in the development version.Slice Text, Character Position and Text InfoWe’ve added a few new nodes for text manipulation.And here’s a quick demo of what you can do with themThe Posterize node reduces the number of colors in an image, creating a stylized effect. It works by mapping the colors in the input image to a limited set of colors based on the specified number of levels.We added a node for that. There are 2 modes available: RGB and Luminance. The latter will produce grayscale posterization.We are still working on fixes and improvements after the 2.0 release along with a Brush Engine.

Maar tegelijk wil men niet onderhandelen tegen eender welke prijs. Mensen zijn de oorlog moe."En dat is net de bedoeling van die onophoudelijke luchtaanvallen, zegt Leyts. "Ze willen de vastberadenheid van de mensen breken en zorgen dat hun moreel erop achteruit gaat. Als je een hele nacht niet deftig hebt geslapen, ga je makkelijker toegevingen doen. Dat is die hele psychologische oorlogsvoering."Op steun uit de VS rekenen de Oekraïners eigenlijk niet meer. Zeker niet nadat Poetin door Trump royaal werd ontvangen in Alaska. "Een oorlogsmisdadiger in hun ogen die met zoveel egards wordt ontvangen, dat is heel slecht aangekomen. Sindsdien is het geloof enorm gezakt dat Trump een vredesduif kan zijn."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia reportedly prepared sabotage in Poland, Lithuania and Germany using disguised explosives</title><link>https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/10/02/8000866/</link><author>/u/YarrowFabiana</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 07:52:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Support Ukrainska Pravda on]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Running Blender on Linux with Termux:X11</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1nvxlvg/running_blender_on_linux_with_termuxx11/</link><author>/u/OutrageousPassion678</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 07:51:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This runs 100% local and offline.

Orchestrating Policy-Driven Tests with Kyverno, Argo Events, and Testkube -- Sonali Srivastava, Technology Evangelist at Improving
As Kubernetes adoption grows, each deployment introduces potential security, compliance, and operational risks that manual governance cannot scale to address. DevOps teams deploy code multiple times a day, while security and compliance teams demand thorough reviews. The result is often a trade-off: either slowing innovation or weakening security posture. Over time, configurations drift from intended standards, while frameworks like SOC 2, PCI DSS, and GDPR demand continuous proof of compliance. Policy-as-Code helps close this gap by codifying rules such as resource limits and compliance checks directly in Kubernetes. In this talk, we'll show how policies can do more than enforce guardrails; they can trigger automated tests. Using Kyverno for policy enforcement, Argo Events for event capture, and Testkube for test orchestration, we'll demonstrate how violations can automatically run smoke or regression tests, providing actionable feedback instead of simply blocking deployments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Kyverno has Changed Platform Engineering Security -- Pedro Ignacio, Itaú Unibanco</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWDuJ94NhGo</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bWDuJ94NhGo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 00:46:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Kyverno Gets Smarter: Writing Dynamic Policies with CEL -- Koray Oksay, Kubernetes Consultat at Kubermatic
Kyverno’s YAML-first policy model is easy to adopt, but as complexity grows, traditional match and pattern rules can become flaky or overly verbose. CEL (Common Expression Language), a game-changing addition that brings dynamic, context-aware logic, now supports Kyverno policies to overcome this. In this session, you’ll learn how CEL unlocks a new level of flexibility in Kyverno. We will explore how to write cleaner, smarter policies by embedding CEL expressions into validation conditions, preconditions, and match logic. You’ll see real-world use cases where CEL simplifies policy writing, improves performance, and enables previously impossible or challenging tasks in pure YAML. Whether you’re writing policies for security, governance, or multi-tenant control, CEL gives you the power to go beyond boilerplate YAML and build dynamic, context-sensitive guardrails without leaving Kubernetes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Green Platform Engineering: Sustainable Kubernetes with Kyverno Policies -- Rajeev Samuel Devadas</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kje6kQK2J3k</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Kje6kQK2J3k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 00:46:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Green Platform Engineering: Sustainable Kubernetes with Kyverno Policies -- Rajeev Samuel Devadas, Application Consultant Architect at IBM Corp's Hybrid Cloud Transformation Division
Platform engineering teams increasingly prioritize sustainability alongside developer experience. This presentation explores how Kyverno policies enable organizations to build environmentally conscious Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that reduce resource waste while enhancing developer productivity. We'll demonstrate how policy-as-code approaches help teams achieve their sustainability goals without sacrificing innovation or deployment velocity. Our analysis shows that implementing resource optimization policies through Kyverno reduces cluster resource consumption by 40% while improving application performance. We'll showcase practical policies that automatically right-size workloads, enforce resource limits, and prevent overprovisioning. The session includes real examples of mutation policies that inject sustainability best practices, such as automatic horizontal pod autoscaler configurations and efficient container image selection based on size and vulnerability metrics. We'll present a comprehensive framework for building self-service platforms where Kyverno policies guide developers toward sustainable choices. This includes integration patterns with developer portals like Backstage, where policy validations provide immediate feedback on resource efficiency. We'll demonstrate how generate policies can automatically create namespace quotas and limit ranges that balance developer freedom with environmental responsibility. Advanced examples will cover using Kyverno's background scans to identify and remediate resource waste in existing deployments. Attendees will learn strategies for implementing graduated policy enforcement that educates developers while preventing unsustainable practices. We'll share metrics dashboards that visualize the environmental impact of policy decisions and demonstrate how platform teams can use Kyverno to report on sustainability KPIs. This session equips platform engineers with practical tools to build developer platforms that deliver exceptional experiences while contributing to organizational sustainability goals through intelligent policy automation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I Broke My Cluster with Kyverno (So You Don’t Have To) -- Vinod Kumar, Arcesium India</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZLcTBaFebo</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JZLcTBaFebo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 00:46:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

I Broke My Cluster with Kyverno (So You Don’t Have To) -- Vinod Kumar, Principal Cloud Engineer at Arcesium India
Working with Kyverno is powerful but with great policy comes great responsibility! In this light-hearted, fast-paced talk, I will share how I accidentally broke my Kubernetes cluster (more than once!) using Kyverno policies that were too strict, too recursive, or just misunderstood. This talk will walk through: (1) The top 3 mistakes I made (e.g., blocking all workloads, infinite policy loops, and bad patching) (2) How to debug and recover from Kyverno policy mishaps (3) Pro tips to write safe, testable, and non-destructive policies Whether you are just starting out or already using Kyverno in production, you will walk away with laughs, learnings, and policy patterns that won’t bring your cluster to its knees.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Scaling Developer Self-Service: Kyverno Policies for Inclusive Platform Engineering- Divya Chaudhary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YIL-gBjTKg</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6YIL-gBjTKg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 00:46:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Scaling Developer Self-Service: Kyverno Policies for Inclusive Platform Engineering -- Divya Chaudhary, Software Development Manager at Amazon
Digital transformation demands scalable platforms that serve diverse developer populations effectively. This presentation explores how Kyverno policies can create inclusive self-service experiences that parallel successful financial inclusion models—reducing barriers, enabling microservices at scale, and formalizing shadow IT practices. We'll demonstrate how thoughtfully designed Kyverno policies dramatically reduce operational friction for developers, similar to how digital payment systems transformed financial access. Through practical examples, attendees will learn to implement policies that provide guardrails without gatekeeping, enabling teams with varying expertise levels to deploy safely. The session covers using Kyverno's mutation capabilities to automatically inject best practices, reducing the knowledge barrier for junior developers while maintaining platform standards. Critical implementation strategies include creating proportional policies that scale requirements with risk levels, implementing multi-channel policy education through generate policies and developer portals, and leveraging Kyverno's reporting features to identify and address adoption barriers. We'll showcase real-world patterns where policy-as-code reduced deployment failures by standardizing configurations while preserving developer flexibility. The presentation concludes with metrics-driven approaches to measure policy effectiveness in expanding platform access, ensuring your Kubernetes environment serves as a catalyst for innovation rather than a barrier to entry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Steam On Linux Use Up 1% From Last September</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Steam-September-2925</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Oct 2025 00:10:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Valve just published the Steam Survey results for September with a slight increase to the Linux gaming userbase...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nevada is home to more than 600 ghost towns #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/32Cp6UJglsI</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/32Cp6UJglsI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 1 Oct 2025 23:18:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Vox producer Dolly Li road tripped through northern Nevada to try and find some of these hidden ghost towns and learn about the real history behind the boom and bust cycles of mining in the state.

Kubernetes Operators are built around this concept and Platform Engineering, an emerging discipline in the ecosystem, often centers around it as well.

This continued success of the KRM raises a question: Why not use the Kubernetes API without the intention to orchestrate containers? kcp, a CNCF Sandbox project, adds stronger multi-tenancy and additional API management capabilities on top of the Kubernetes API server code. It supercharges the KRM to be used as a generic control plane for any kind of declarative APIs.

There had just been a Nintendo Direct on September 12, after all, where Nintendo announced the next mainline entry in the series for Switch 2, Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave. There was no mention of Fire Emblem Shadows. And after playing it, I can see why Nintendo wouldn't showcase it on that big stageI assumed it was referring to Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon, the 2009 remake of the first game in the series, and went on with my day. It was only later that evening I learned that Fire Emblem Shadows was actually a brand-new mobile entry in the series: one where players manage "real-time strategy and social deduction at the same time."The idea of a new game in the long-running tactics series arriving out of the blue had me eager to install it and see what it was about. I had a decent time with Fire Emblem Heroes, Nintendo's previous attempt at translating Fire Emblem to the world of free-to-play mobile games (and one that would go on to become Nintendo's first mobile game to hit $1 billion in revenue). As such, I was curious to see how Shadows, which is also free to play, would differ. Unfortunately, the monkey paw soon curled, and I found myself dumbfounded by all the ways Fire Emblem Shadows is Fire Emblem in name only.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI’s new slop machine is open for business…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkSj-QapfZo</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hkSj-QapfZo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 1 Oct 2025 18:38:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Try out Blitzy’s codegen platform for enterprise codebases for free - https://blitzy.com

OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls "cameos."OpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden.Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls "sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism." In May, Google's Veo 3 became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released Wan 2.5, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pete Buttigieg responds to Tucker Carlson “fake gay” claims</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/d4NOTAu48Y0</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/d4NOTAu48Y0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 1 Oct 2025 18:22:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jane Goodall has died</title><link>https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2025-10-01/jane-goodall-chimpanzees-dead</link><author>jaredwiener</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 1 Oct 2025 18:10:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jane Goodall, the trailblazing naturalist whose intimate observations of chimpanzees in the African wild produced powerful insights that transformed basic conceptions of humankind, has died. She was 91.A tireless advocate of preserving chimpanzees’ natural habitat, Goodall died on Wednesday morning in California of natural causes, the Jane Goodall Institute announced on its Instagram page. “Dr. Goodall’s discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science,” the Jane Goodall Institute said in a statement. A protege of anthropologist Louis S.B. Leakey, Goodall made history in 1960 when she discovered that chimpanzees, humankind’s closest living relatives, made and used tools, characteristics that scientists had long thought were exclusive to humans.She also found that chimps hunted prey, ate meat, and were capable of a range of emotions and behaviors similar to those of humans, including filial love, grief and violence bordering on warfare.In the course of establishing one of the world’s longest-running studies of wild animal behavior at what is now Tanzania’s Gombe Stream National Park, she gave her chimp subjects names instead of numbers, a practice that raised eyebrows in the male-dominated field of primate studies in the 1960s. But within a decade, the trim British scientist with the tidy ponytail was a National Geographic heroine, whose books and films educated a worldwide audience with stories of the apes she called David Graybeard, Mr. McGregor, Gilka and Flo.“When we read about a woman who gives funny names to chimpanzees and then follows them into the bush, meticulously recording their every grunt and groom, we are reluctant to admit such activity into the big leagues,” the late biologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote of the scientific world’s initial reaction to Goodall.But Goodall overcame her critics and produced work that Gould later characterized as “one of the Western world’s great scientific achievements.”Tenacious and keenly observant, Goodall paved the way for other women in primatology, including the late gorilla researcher Dian Fossey and orangutan expert Birutė Galdikas. She was honored in 1995 with the National Geographic Society’s Hubbard Medal, which then had been bestowed only 31 times in the previous 90 years to such eminent figures as North Pole explorer Robert E. Peary and aviator Charles Lindbergh.In her 80s she continued to travel 300 days a year to speak to schoolchildren and others about the need to fight deforestation, preserve chimpanzees’ natural habitat and promote sustainable development in Africa. She was in California as part of her speaking tour in the U.S. at the time of her death.Goodall was born April 3, 1934, in London and grew up in the English coastal town of Bournemouth. The daughter of a businessman and a writer who separated when she was a child and later divorced, she was raised in a matriarchal household that included her maternal grandmother, her mother, Vanne, some aunts and her sister, Judy.She demonstrated an affinity for nature from a young age, filling her bedroom with worms and sea snails that she rushed back to their natural homes after her mother told her they would otherwise die.When she was about 5, she disappeared for hours to a dark henhouse to see how chickens laid eggs, so absorbed that she was oblivious to her family’s frantic search for her. She did not abandon her study until she observed the wondrous event.“Suddenly with a plop, the egg landed on the straw. With clucks of pleasure the hen shook her feathers, nudged the egg with her beak, and left,” Goodall wrote almost 60 years later. “It is quite extraordinary how clearly I remember that whole sequence of events.”When finally she ran out of the henhouse with the exciting news, her mother did not scold her but patiently listened to her daughter’s account of her first scientific observation.Later, she gave Goodall books about animals and adventure — especially the Doctor Dolittle tales and Tarzan. Her daughter became so enchanted with Tarzan’s world that she insisted on doing her homework in a tree.“I was madly in love with the Lord of the Jungle, terribly jealous of his Jane,” Goodall wrote in her 1999 memoir, “Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey.” “It was daydreaming about life in the forest with Tarzan that led to my determination to go to Africa, to live with animals and write books about them.”Her opportunity came after she finished high school. A week before Christmas in 1956 she was invited to visit an old school chum’s family farm in Kenya. Goodall saved her earnings from a waitress job until she had enough for a round-trip ticket.She arrived in Kenya in 1957, thrilled to be living in the Africa she had “always felt stirring in my blood.” At a dinner party in Nairobi shortly after her arrival, someone told her that if she was interested in animals, she should meet Leakey, already famous for his discoveries in East Africa of man’s fossil ancestors.She went to see him at what’s now the National Museum of Kenya, where he was curator. He hired her as a secretary and soon had her helping him and his wife, Mary, dig for fossils at Olduvai Gorge, a famous site in the Serengeti Plains in what is now northern Tanzania.Leakey spoke to her of his desire to learn more about all the great apes. He said he had heard of a community of chimpanzees on the rugged eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika where an intrepid researcher might make valuable discoveries.When Goodall told him this was exactly the kind of work she dreamed of doing, Leakey agreed to send her there.It took Leakey two years to find funding, which gave Goodall time to study primate behavior and anatomy in London. She finally landed in Gombe in the summer of 1960.On a rocky outcropping she called the Peak, Goodall made her first important observation. Scientists had thought chimps were docile vegetarians, but on this day about three months after her arrival, Goodall spied a group of the apes feasting on something pink. It turned out to be a baby bush pig.Two weeks later, she made an even more exciting discovery — the one that would establish her reputation. She had begun to recognize individual chimps, and on a rainy October day in 1960, she spotted the one with white hair on his chin. He was sitting beside a mound of red earth, carefully pushing a blade of grass into a hole, then withdrawing it and poking it into his mouth.When he finally ambled off, Goodall hurried over for a closer look. She picked up the abandoned grass stalk, stuck it into the same hole and pulled it out to find it covered with termites. The chimp she later named David Graybeard had been using the stalk to fish for the bugs.“It was hard for me to believe what I had seen,” Goodall later wrote. “It had long been thought that we were the only creatures on earth that used and made tools. ‘Man the Toolmaker’ is how we were defined ...” What Goodall saw challenged man’s uniqueness.When she sent her report to Leakey, he responded: “We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!”Goodall’s startling finding, published in Nature in 1964, enabled Leakey to line up funding to extend her stay at Gombe. It also eased Goodall’s admission to Cambridge University to study ethology. In 1965, she became the eighth person in Cambridge history to earn a doctorate without first having a bachelor’s degree.In the meantime, she had met and in 1964 married Hugo Van Lawick, a gifted filmmaker who had traveled to Gombe to make a documentary about her chimp project. They had a child, Hugo Eric Louis — later nicknamed Grub — in 1967.Goodall later said that raising Grub, who lived at Gombe until he was 9, gave her insights into the behavior of chimp mothers. Conversely, she had “no doubt that my observation of the chimpanzees helped me to be a better mother.”She and Van Lawick were married for 10 years, divorcing in 1974. The following year she married Derek Bryceson, director of Tanzania National Parks. He died of colon cancer four years later.Within a year of arriving at Gombe, Goodall had chimps literally eating out of her hands. Toward the end of her second year there, David Graybeard, who had shown the least fear of her, was the first to allow her physical contact. She touched him lightly and he permitted her to groom him for a full minute before gently pushing her hand away. For an adult male chimpanzee who had grown up in the wild to tolerate physical contact with a human was, she wrote in her 1971 book “In the Shadow of Man,” “a Christmas gift to treasure.”Her studies yielded a trove of other observations on behaviors, including etiquette (such as soliciting a pat on the rump to indicate submission) and the sex lives of chimps. She collected some of the most fascinating information on the latter by watching Flo, an older female with a bulbous nose and an amazing retinue of suitors who was bearing children well into her 40s.Her reports initially caused much skepticism in the scientific community. “I was not taken very seriously by many of the scientists. I was known as a [National] Geographic cover girl,” she recalled in a CBS interview in 2012.Her unorthodox personalizing of the chimps was particularly controversial. The editor of one of her first published papers insisted on crossing out all references to the creatures as “he” or “she” in favor of “it.” Goodall eventually prevailed.Her most disturbing studies came in the mid-1970s, when she and her team of field workers began to record a series of savage attacks.The incidents grew into what Goodall called the four-year war, a period of brutality carried out by a band of male chimpanzees from a region known as the Kasakela Valley. The marauders beat and slashed to death all the males in a neighboring colony and subjugated the breeding females, essentially annihilating an entire community.It was the first time a scientist had witnessed organized aggression by one group of non-human primates against another. Goodall said this “nightmare time” forever changed her view of ape nature.“During the first 10 years of the study I had believed ... that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings,” she wrote in “Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey,” a 1999 book co-authored with Phillip Berman. “Then suddenly we found that the chimpanzees could be brutal — that they, like us, had a dark side to their nature.”Critics tried to dismiss the evidence as merely anecdotal. Others thought she was wrong to publicize the violence, fearing that irresponsible scientists would use the information to “prove” that the tendency to war is innate in humans, a legacy from their ape ancestors. Goodall persisted in talking about the attacks, maintaining that her purpose was not to support or debunk theories about human aggression but to “understand a little better” the nature of chimpanzee aggression.“My question was: How far along our human path, which has led to hatred and evil and full-scale war, have chimpanzees traveled?”Her observations of chimp violence marked a turning point for primate researchers, who had considered it taboo to talk about chimpanzee behavior in human terms. But by the 1980s, much chimp behavior was being interpreted in ways that would have been labeled anthropomorphism — ascribing human traits to non-human entities — decades earlier. Goodall, in removing the barriers, raised primatology to new heights, opening the way for research on subjects ranging from political coalitions among baboons to the use of deception by an array of primates.Her concern about protecting chimpanzees in the wild and in captivity led her in 1977 to found the Jane Goodall Institute to advocate for great apes and support research and public education. She also established Roots and Shoots, a program aimed at youths in 130 countries, and TACARE, which involves African villagers in sustainable development.She became an international ambassador for chimps and conservation in 1986 when she saw a film about the mistreatment of laboratory chimps. The secretly taped footage “was like looking into the Holocaust,” she told interviewer Cathleen Rountree in 1998. From that moment, she became a globe-trotting crusader for animal rights. In the 2017 documentary “Jane,” the producer  pored through 140 hours of footage of Goodall that had been hidden away in the National Geographic archives. The film won a Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. Award, one of many honors it received.In a ranging 2009 interview with Times columnist Patt Morrison, Goodall mused on topics from traditional zoos — she said most captive environments should be abolished — to climate change, a battle she feared humankind was quickly losing, if not lost already. She also spoke about the power of what one human can accomplish.“I always say, ‘If you would spend just a little bit of time learning about the consequences of the choices you make each day’ — what you buy, what you eat, what you wear, how you interact with people and animals — and start consciously making choices, that would be beneficial rather than harmful.”As the years  passed, Goodall continued to track Gombe’s chimps, accumulating enough information to draw the arcs of their lives — from birth through sometimes troubled adolescence, maturity, illness and finally death.She wrote movingly about how she followed Mr. McGregor, an older, somewhat curmudgeonly chimp, through his agonizing death from polio, and how the orphan Gilka survived to lonely adulthood only to have her babies snatched from her by a pair of cannibalistic female chimps.Her reaction in 1972 to the death of Flo, a prolific female known as Gombe’s most devoted mother, suggested the depth of feeling that Goodall had for the animals. Knowing that Flo’s faithful son Flint was nearby and grieving, Goodall watched over the body all night to keep marauding bush pigs from violating her remains.“People say to me, thank you for giving them characters and personalities,” Goodall once told CBS’s “60 Minutes.” “I said I didn’t give them anything. I merely translated them for people.”Woo is a former Times staff writer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Deep Beauty of Our Solar System | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKmYgSAbVYU</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/iKmYgSAbVYU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 1 Oct 2025 18:00:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sit back, relax and enjoy  a 1 hour deep dive into the wonders of our splendacious solar system.

We’ve all been conditioned to believe that workplace politics is this dirty game played by manipulative ladder-climbers while the “real” engineers focus on the code.I used to think the same way. For years as an engineer, I wore my hatred of politics like a badge of honor. I was above all that nonsense. I just wanted to ship. Politics was for those other people, the ones who didn’t have what it takes technically.Now I think the opposite: politics isn’t the problem; bad politics is. And pretending politics doesn’t exist? That’s how bad politics wins.Politics is just how humans coordinate in groups. It’s the invisible network of relationships, influence, and informal power that exists in every organization. You can refuse to participate, but that doesn’t make it go away. It just means decisions get made without you.Think about the last time a terrible technical decision got pushed through at your company. Maybe it was adopting some overcomplicated architecture, or choosing a vendor that everyone knew was wrong, or killing a project that was actually working. I bet if you dig into what happened, you’ll find it wasn’t because the decision-makers were stupid. It’s because the people with the right information weren’t in the room. They “didn’t do politics.”Meanwhile, someone who understood how influence works was in that room, making their case, building coalitions, showing they’d done their homework. And their idea won. Not because it was better, but because they showed up to play while everyone else was “too pure” for politics.Ideas don’t speak. People do. And the people who understand how to navigate organizational dynamics, build relationships, and yes, play politics? Their ideas get heard.When you build strong relationships across teams, understand what motivates different stakeholders, and know how to build consensus, you’re doing politics. When you take time to explain your technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders in language they understand, that’s politics. When you grab coffee with someone from another team to understand their challenges, that’s politics too.Good politics is just being strategic about relationships and influence in the service of good outcomes.The best technical leaders are incredibly political. They just don’t call it that. They call it “stakeholder management” or “building alignment” or “organizational awareness.” But it’s politics, and they’re good at it.The engineers who refuse to engage with politics often complain that their companies make bad technical decisions. But they’re not willing to do what it takes to influence those decisions. They want a world where technical merit alone determines outcomes. That world doesn’t exist and never has.This isn’t about becoming a scheming backstabber. As I wrote in Your Strengths Are Your Weaknesses, the same trait can be positive or negative depending on how you use it. Politics is the same way. You can use political skills to manipulate and self-promote, or you can use them to get good ideas implemented and protect your team from bad decisions.Here’s what good politics looks like in practice:Building relationships before you need them. That random coffee with someone from the data team? Six months later, they’re your biggest advocate for getting engineering resources for your data pipeline project.Understanding the real incentives. Your VP doesn’t care about your beautiful microservices architecture. They care about shipping features faster. Frame your technical proposals in terms of what they actually care about. Your manager is juggling competing priorities you don’t see. Keep them informed about what matters, flag problems early with potential solutions, and help them make good decisions. When they trust you to handle things, they’ll fight for you when it mattersCreating win-win situations. Instead of fighting for resources, find ways to help other teams while getting what you need. It doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. If you do great work but nobody knows about it, did it really happen? Share your wins, present at all-hands, write those design docs that everyone will reference later.The alternative to good politics isn’t no politics. It’s bad politics winning by default. It’s the loud person who’s wrong getting their way because the quiet person who’s right won’t speak up. It’s good projects dying because nobody advocated for them. It’s talented people leaving because they couldn’t navigate the organizational dynamics.Stop pretending you’re above politics. You’re not. Nobody is. The only question is whether you’ll get good at it or keep losing to people who already are.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2387 - Gregg Braden</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Wqw8Az7TA</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/J3Wqw8Az7TA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 1 Oct 2025 17:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Gregg Braden is an author, scientist, and educator.

Nine years in a penal colony: That is the sentence Zarema Musayeva has to serve because her sons rebelled against Chechen ruler Ramzan Kadyrov. Zarema’s family is doing everything they can to ensure she is not forgotten.

Every dictator has their own way of intimidating opponents. In Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov punishes human rights activists by imprisoning someone close to them. Abubakar, Ibragim and Baisangur Yangulbayev are vocal critics of Ramzan Kadyrov. They denounce abuses in Chechnya on the internet and were forced to flee Russia. Their mother Zarema Musayeva was less fortunate. In January 2022, authorities abducted her from her home in Nizhny Novgorod, some 1,800 kilometers from the Chechen capital Grozny. Her health has deteriorated significantly since then. She suffers from diabetes but is forced to do hard labor. Zarema is paying a high price for the commitment of her sons, who are continuing their actions in exile in the hope that international attention will save their mother's life.

Maria Garcia is one of them. She is a healer who is preserving her ancestors’ knowledge of medicinal plants. But the forests and nature on which the Maya rely are under threat from logging and climate change. 

Maria Garcia founded an organization that protects 5,000 hectares of rainforest. Together with a group of rangers, the organization patrols the area to keep it safe.  

“The rangers are the soul of this park. They are the ones who take care of everything – from the logging to the looting, to the hunting. When you know the struggle [...] then you know how important this area is and you will fight for it with all your heart. It’s not about the money. It’s about preserving the balance that we have. Because our sacred lands are fast disappearing,” says Maria.

If it’s taken, it even suggests  on the spot.For a small startup with only a few thousand users, this check is simple—a quick database query will do. But for platforms like Instagram, Google, or X (formerly Twitter), with , the challenge is far greater.They can’t possibly scan through billions of records every time someone signs up.So how do they make it happen in the blink of an eye?In this article, we will walk through the journey of how these systems are built, starting with the most basic approach and leveling up to the sophisticated architecture used at Big Tech scale.The most straightforward way to check if a username exists is to query the database:SELECT COUNT(1) 
FROM users 
WHERE username = ‘new_user’;If the count is greater than zero, the username is already taken. If it’s zero, the username is available.For a small system with thousands or even a few million users, this works just fine. A well-indexed relational database can return the result in milliseconds.But things start to look very different once you scale to hundreds of millions or even billions of users, spread across multiple servers and data centers. Even with efficient data structures like B-trees or hash indexes, scanning and maintaining them takes longer.Databases get overloaded. Every sign-up attempt means another query, creating heavy read traffic on already busy systems.In short: while direct queries are  and , they simply don’t scale to the demands of Big Tech. At billions of records, this approach would quickly grind to a halt.The next natural optimization is .Instead of hitting the database every single time a user tries a new username, we keep a temporary copy of frequently checked usernames in memory (using tools like  or ). The request first goes to the application server.The system checks the cache to see if this username has been queried recently. → return the result instantly (no need to touch the database). → move on to the database.Database check (fallback): If the cache misses, the application queries the database for the authoritative result.Update cache (future optimization): Once the database returns the answer, the system updates the cache so the next time someone checks the same username, it’s available instantly from memory.This works beautifully for usernames that are checked often. For example, if thousands of people keep trying names like , , or , the cache can serve those requests instantly without touching the database at all.But caching introduces new trade-offs: You can’t possibly store billions of usernames in memory forever, it’s just too expensive. Systems often rely on eviction policies like Least Recently Used (LRU) to keep only the “hot” entries. If a username becomes available (say a user deletes their account), but the cache isn’t updated in time, the system may mistakenly think it’s still taken. This is usually solved with  values so cached data eventually expires. Unique usernames still have to go all the way to the database the first time they’re queried.Now things get interesting.Instead of storing every single username explicitly in memory or querying the database each time, what if we stored a  that could tell us whether a username  exist?A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that can very quickly answer the question: “Might this username exist in the system?”If the filter says , you can be 100% sure the username does not exist.If it says , the username  exist, and you double-check in the cache or database.Bloom filters trade a tiny probability of false positives for extreme speed and memory efficiency.Why Bloom Filters are Powerful With ~1.2 GB of memory, a Bloom filter can represent around  with just a . Checking a few bits in memory is much faster than hitting a cache or database.A Bloom filter starts as a large array of bits, all set to .Suppose a user signs up with .The username is run through several different  (say 3–10).Each hash function produces a position in the bit array, and those positions are flipped to .When someone later tries , the same hash functions are applied.The system checks the corresponding bits:If , the username has definitely never been seen → it’s available.If , the username is probably taken.The Catch: False PositivesSometimes, a new username’s hash positions may overlap with ones set by other usernames. This means the filter might say “maybe taken” when the username is actually free.That’s why Bloom filters are always followed by a  for confirmation in case of false positives (~1% of the requests).When you type  and hit enter, here’s what happens behind the scenes in a large-scale system:Your request first first hits a , which routes it to the nearest or least-busy server.Bloom Filter (Primary Check)The server first checks in-memory Bloom filter.If the Bloom filter says the server instantly returns the response “Available!“Most usernames are unique, so the vast majority of requests end here, without touching the cache or database.Cache Check (Secondary Check)If the Bloom filter says , the system consults the distributed cache (Redis/Memcached).If the username was checked recently, the cache instantly returns the definitive answer.Database Check (Final Check)Only if the cache also misses does the request go to the .This is not a single machine but a  (Cassandra, DynamoDB, or Spanner) spread across thousands of servers.Under the hood, indexing structures like  keep lookups efficient— even at massive scale.The database returns the final .On the way back, the result is written into the cache so the next lookup for the same username is instant.This layered approach acts as a funnel, where each step filters out a large number of requests, ensuring that only a tiny fraction ever need to make the “expensive” trip to the main database.Up to this point, we’ve been talking about simple : Does this username exist or not?But real-world platforms like Instagram go further. They also suggest  if your first choice is taken.Take the username  for example. If it’s already in use, Instagram might suggest:These features require something smarter than a  or a . They rely on a data structure purpose-built for : the A  is a tree-like structure that organizes strings by their shared prefixes. Instead of storing usernames as whole words, it breaks them down character by character, reusing common paths. becomes  shares the path  before branching into .Tries unlock a set of capabilities that databases and caches struggle with: Checking whether a username exists takes time proportional only to the length of the string (), not the total number of usernames.For , that’s just 6 steps even if there are billions of usernames in the system. By following a partial path, the trie can instantly list all usernames starting with a given prefix (e.g., ). Since similar usernames share common paths, generating alternatives like  or  becomes easy and efficient.Tries come with trade-offs too: If usernames don’t share many prefixes, the trie branches can grow explosively, consuming large amounts of memory. Inserting or deleting usernames in real-time requires careful synchronization in distributed environments.To reduce memory usage, compressed tries (also called radix trees) are often used.Instead of storing every single character as a node, compressed tries collapse chains of single-child nodes into one edge.This saves both space and lookup steps, making the structure more practical at scale.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

It had been more than a year since proceedings in what was being called “the trial of the century” began, and America was on edge. Millions of households across the U.S. had tuned in to wall-to-wall coverage of onetime American icon O.J. Simpson’s trial for the brutal double murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. 

Then, on Oct. 3, 1995, came a televised verdict, watched by more than 150 million people, that shook the country along racial lines — sparking both consternation and celebration, and raising profound questions about the criminal justice system, fairness and America’s racial divide.

Initially released 10 years after the not-guilty verdict was handed down, “The O.J. Verdict” was directed by Ofra Bikel, an award-winning FRONTLINE filmmaker whose body of work exposed flaws in the U.S. criminal justice system and helped bring about the exonerations of at least 13 people. 

Through extensive interviews with both the prosecution and defense teams, as well as journalists who covered the proceedings, this acclaimed documentary offers an in-depth look at how the trial played out and what it revealed about the nation.

In many cases, these protections—which work by storing certain data and processes inside encrypted enclaves known as TEEs (Trusted Execution Enclaves)—are essential for safeguarding secrets stored in the cloud by the likes of Signal Messenger and WhatsApp. All major cloud providers recommend that customers use it. Intel calls its protection SGX, and AMD has named it SEV-SNP.Over the years, researchers have repeatedly broken the security and privacy promises that Intel and AMD have made about their respective protections. On Tuesday, researchers independently published two papers laying out separate attacks that further demonstrate the limitations of SGX and SEV-SNP. One attack, dubbed Battering RAM, defeats both protections and allows attackers to not only view encrypted data but also to actively manipulate it to introduce software backdoors or to corrupt data. A separate attack known as Wiretap is able to passively decrypt sensitive data protected by SGX and remain invisible at all times.Attacking deterministic encryptionBoth attacks use a small piece of hardware, known as an interposer, that sits between CPU silicon and the memory module. Its position allows the interposer to observe data as it passes from one to the other. They exploit both Intel’s and AMD’s use of deterministic encryption, which produces the same ciphertext each time the same plaintext is encrypted with a given key. In SGX and SEV-SNP, that means the same plaintext written to the same memory address always produces the same ciphertext.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DeepSeek tests “sparse attention” to slash AI processing costs</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/09/deepseek-tests-sparse-attention-to-slash-ai-processing-costs/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2195894561-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 20:18:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever wonder why ChatGPT slows down during long conversations? The culprit is a fundamental mathematical challenge: Processing long sequences of text requires massive computational resources, even with the efficiency tricks that companies have already deployed. While US tech giants can afford to throw more hardware at the problem, Chinese AI company DeepSeek, which is cut off from a steady supply of some advanced AI chips by export restrictions, has extra motivation to squeeze more performance from less silicon.On Monday, DeepSeek released an experimental version of its latest simulated reasoning language model, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, which introduces what it calls "DeepSeek Sparse Attention" (DSA). It's the company's implementation of a computational technique likely already used in some of the world's most prominent AI models. OpenAI pioneered sparse transformers in 2019 and used the technique to build GPT-3, while Google Research published work on "Reformer" models using similar concepts in 2020. (The full extent to which Western AI companies currently use sparse attention in their latest models remains undisclosed.)Despite sparse attention being a known approach for years, DeepSeek claims its version achieves "fine-grained sparse attention for the first time" and has cut API prices by 50 percent to demonstrate the efficiency gains. But to understand more about what makes DeepSeek v3.2 notable, it's useful to refresh yourself on a little AI history.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inflammation now predicts heart disease more strongly than cholesterol</title><link>https://www.empirical.health/blog/inflammation-and-heart-health/</link><author>brandonb</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 20:00:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Inflammation now predicts heart disease better than cholesterolChronic inflammation has long been known to double your risk of heart disease, but prior to now,
inflammation has never been a SMuRF: tandard odifiable isk actor for heart disease.The American College of Cardiology just released recommendations that change that. The ACC is now recommending that everyone
measure inflammation (specifically, hs-CRP) via a blood test:Because clinicians will not treat what they do not measure, universal screening of hsCRP in both primary and secondary prevention patients, in combination with cholesterol, represents a major clinical opportunity and is therefore recommended. American College of CardiologyThere were many interesting bits of evidence that led to this recommendation. The whole article, published in JACC, is worth a read, but this blog post extracts a few of the most interesting parts — or at
least, the parts I thought were most interesting.
Want to skip ahead and measure your inflammation? Empirical Health's advanced heart health panel includes hs-CRP, ApoB, Lp(a), and other critical heart health biomarkers.
For decades, LDL cholesterol (or ApoB) has been the main focus of cardiovascular risk assessment. But this chart shows hs-CRP is actually a  predictor of cardiovascular events than LDL.Why? In some ways, cholesterol has become a victim of its own success. We now screen the whole population
for high cholesterol, give statins to those with high LDL (or ApoB), and so then the majority of people who
end up having heart attacks have lower cholesterol than they would naturally have. This means most of
the majority of residual risk for heart attacks will be found in biomarkers that aren’t SMuRFs.Inflammation (hs-CRP) is one such non-SMuRF, one perhaps one of the strongest. This is especially true
in people already on statins or those without traditional risk factors (sometimes called “SMuRF-less” patients).
In these groups, cholesterol may be well controlled, but inflammation remains a key driver of events.Of course, other traditional risk factors matter  to inflammation: blood pressure, HbA1c or
insulin resistance, eGFR (kidney function), and so on.The ACC consensus reviews a range of clinical trials testing both drugs and lifestyle interventions for lowering inflammation and reducing cardiovascular risk. Here’s a summary of the clinical trials and their results:Population/NYHA Functional ClassInfliximab (TNF inhibitor)Clinical status (composite score)No improvement or worsening; deaths highest in high-dose infliximabComposite all-cause mortality and CV hospitalizationNo reduction in events; trend toward benefit in NYHA III and IVNonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CV death (MACE); HF-related mortalityReduced MACE and HF events; no effect on all-cause mortality; primary endpoint events: 3.86% vs 4.50%No effect on CV events, inflammation, or lipidsDeath from CV causes, recurrent MI, ischemic strokeNo significant difference in primary endpointCV events lower than placeboComposite of CV death, nonfatal MI, ischemic stroke, or ischemia-driven revasc.CV events lower than placeboAll-cause mortality and CV hospitalizationNo effect on primary endpointsNo CVD / LDL <130 mg/dL; hsCRP ≥2 mg/LMI, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or CV deathReduced events (HR 0.56–0.69)NYHA II-IV HF; ischemic etiologyCV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal strokeNo effect on primary endpointEtanercept (TNF inhibitor)Death, hospitalization, or worsening HFNo effect on primary endpointPrednisone (corticosteroid)NYHA II-IV HF; biopsy-proven myocarditisImprovement in LVEF, survival, or combined outcome of death or transplantationEtanercept (TNF inhibitor)Composite outcome of death or hospitalizationNo effect on primary endpoint to lower inflammation? (especially in people with high hs-CRP): Substantial reduction in events, even when LDL is normal (JUPITER trial).: Reduces recurrent events in people with established heart disease (COLCOT, LoDoCo2).: Reduces events but is expensive and increases infection risk (CANTOS).: Anti-inflammatory diets (Mediterranean, DASH), regular exercise, smoking cessation, and maintaining a healthy weight all lower hs-CRP and reduce risk.Some anti-inflammatory drugs (methotrexate, TNF inhibitors, corticosteroids) have not shown benefit in major trials.If you’ve already measured your hs-CRP (great!), then it’s ideally below <1 mg/L. hs-CRP above 3 mg/L is
high risk:(If you’re in moderate or high ranges, see the section above for what to do.)The ACC standardized hs-CRP as the marker of inflammation. But the ACC evaluated other markers: IL-6, fibrinogen, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, EPA/AA ratio, and serum amyloid A. While these markers have also been shown to predict cardiovascular risk, once hs-CRP is known, the others don’t add more signal.In other words, you’re best off simply measuring hs-CRP with a blood test, and then spending money elsewhere on heart health.The JACC article is packed with other interesting insights. These ones were interesting: (like CT, PET, MRI, and perivascular “fat attenuation index”) can detect vascular inflammation and may help predict coronary events, but are not yet ready for routine clinical use. is a newer cholesterol-lowering drug that also lowers hs-CRP, but its long-term outcomes are still being studied.Residual inflammatory risk: Even with well-controlled LDL on statins, many people still have elevated hs-CRP and ongoing risk—so inflammation should be addressed separately from cholesterol.Universal hs-CRP screening is now recommended by the ACC for both people with and without established heart disease. is now FDA-approved as an adjunct for secondary prevention in stable ASCVD, but should be avoided in people with significant kidney or liver disease. are being studied as future anti-inflammatory therapies for heart disease.Blood tests for hs-CRP are widely available and inexpensive. Empirical Health’s comprehensive health panel is one option. The ACC now recommends routine hs-CRP testing for both people at risk (primary prevention) and those with established heart disease (secondary prevention).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Glide, an extensible, keyboard-focused web browser</title><link>https://blog.craigie.dev/introducing-glide/</link><author>probablyrobert</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 19:43:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pavel Durov: Telegram, Freedom, Censorship, Money, Power &amp; Human Nature | Lex Fridman Podcast #482</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjPH9njnaVU</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qjPH9njnaVU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 19:27:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pavel Durov is the founder and CEO of Telegram.

The San Andreas Fault, a 1,300-kilometer-long fracture zone in the earth's crust, runs through the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Scientists fear a major earthquake.

The San Andreas Fault is currently the most strongly observed geological phenomenon in the world. Scientists have long feared an earthquake so strong that it could mean the death of thousands of people. Economic damage, running into the billions, would also result. 

Concerns are growing, as seismologists currently estimate that the next earthquake will occur before 2032. They put the probability of this at over 70%. For them, it is a race against time. 

The documentary shows the scientific efforts being made to predict the unpredictable. International seismologists are studying the fault to make more accurate forecasts. The aim is also to reduce the risks for people. 

With the help of 3D animations and aerial photographs, the researchers' fascinating engineering approaches come to light. For them, the question is not whether the big quake will come, but when.

A critical frontier in this evolution is the on-device AI agent, enabling sophisticated, AI-native experiences directly on mobile and embedded devices. While cloud-based AI faces challenges like constant connectivity demands, increased latency, privacy risks, and high operational costs, on-device breaks through these trade-offs.We'll delve into the practical side of building and deploying AI agents with “DeliteAI”, an open-source on-device AI agentic framework. We'll explore how lightweight Python runtimes facilitate the seamless orchestration of end-to-end workflows directly on devices, allowing AI/ML teams to define data preprocessing, feature computation, model execution, and post-processing logic independently of frontend code. This architecture empowers agents to adapt to varying tasks and user contexts through an ecosystem of tools natively supported on Android/iOS platforms, handling all the permissions, model lifecycles, and many more.Varun is the Founder and CEO of NimbleEdge, an AI startup pioneering privacy-first, on-device intelligence. With an academic foundation in AI and neuroscience from UC Berkeley, MPI Frankfurt, and IIT Kanpur, Varun brings deep expertise at the intersection of technology and science. Before founding NimbleEdge, Varun led open-source projects at OpenMined, focusing on privacy-aware AI, and published research in computer vision.Neeraj Poddar is the Co-founder and CTO at NimbleEdge. Prior to NimbleEdge, he was the Co-founder of Aspen Mesh, VP of Engineering at Solo.io, and led the Istio open source community. He has worked on various aspects of AI, networking, security, and distributed systems over the span of his career. Neeraj focuses on the application of open source technologies across different industries in terms of scalability and security. When not working on AI, you can find him playing racquetball and gaining back the calories spent playing by trying out new restaurants. ~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~[00:00] On-device AI skepticism[02:47] Word suggestion for AI[06:40] Optimizing unique challenges[13:39] LLM on-device challenges[20:34] Agent overlord tension[23:56] AI app constraints[29:23] Siri limitations and trust gap[32:01] Voice-driven app privacy[35:49] Platform lock-in vs aggregation[42:26] On-device AI optimizations]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Debate Over The Age of the Universe, with Wendy Freedman</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ddCCSsvOg</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/93ddCCSsvOg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:50:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Can we resolve the crisis in cosmology? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Matt Kirshen take on Hubble Tension, the difference between the estimated ages of the universe, and how to solve it with legendary astronomer Wendy Freedman.

We trace the debate from the early days with Henrietta Leavitt’s discovery of Cepheid variables through today’s most precise measurements. Why do local distance measurements (Cepheids, tip of the red-giant branch, carbon stars) give a different expansion rate than the cosmic microwave background? Could dust be dimming our view, or systematic errors biasing our results? Or do we require discovering new physics?

We break down the Hubble tension and what caused it. How did the Hubble telescope complicate the existing debate, between 10 and 20 billion years old, through more precise measurements? We explore possible explanations: local density fluctuations, evolving dark energy, or something missing from the standard model. Are we missing something fundamental hiding in plain sight? Could the Hubble constant vary with time, or even by location in the universe?

Listener questions push the frontier further: Could dark energy distort our distance calculations? How would we measure expansion if we traveled to another galaxy? Would it matter scientifically, or emotionally, if the universe is finite or infinite? Through it all, Neil reminds us that science isn’t democracy, it’s data.

The law requires companies with annual revenues of at least $500 million to publish safety protocols on their websites and report incidents to state authorities, but it lacks the stronger enforcement teeth of the bill Newsom vetoed last year after tech companies lobbied heavily against it.The legislation, S.B. 53, replaces Senator Scott Wiener's previous attempt at AI regulation, known as S.B. 1047, that would have required safety testing and "kill switches" for AI systems. Instead, the new law asks companies to describe how they incorporate "national standards, international standards, and industry-consensus best practices" into their AI development, without specifying what those standards are or requiring independent verification."California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive," Newsom said in a statement, though the law's actual protective measures remain largely voluntary beyond basic reporting requirements.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kagi News</title><link>https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-news</link><author>grappler</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:09:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A comprehensive daily press review with global news. Fully private, with sources openly curated by our community.News is broken. We all know it, but we’ve somehow accepted it as inevitable. The endless notifications. The clickbait headlines designed to trigger rather than inform, driven by relentless ad monetization. The exhausting cycle of checking multiple apps throughout the day, only to feel more anxious and less informed than when we started. This isn’t what news was supposed to be.
We can do better, and create what news should have been all along: pure, essential information that respects your intelligence and time.Our approach: Signal over noiseKagi News operates on a simple principle: understanding the world requires hearing from the world. Every day, our system reads thousands of community curated RSS feeds from publications across different viewpoints and perspectives. We then use AI to distill this massive information into one comprehensive daily briefing, while clearly citing sources.We strive for diversity and transparency of resources and welcome your contributions to widen perspectives. This multi-source approach helps reveal the full picture beyond any single viewpoint.Design principles that put readers first We publish once per day around noon UTC, creating a natural endpoint to news consumption. This is a deliberate design choice that turns news from an endless habit into a contained ritual.Five-minute complete understanding: Our briefings cover everything important in just five minutes. No endless scrolling. No attention hijacking. You read, understand, and move on with your day.Diversity over echo chambers: Rather than personalizing feeds to match existing preferences, we expose readers to the full spectrum of global perspectives. This approach breaks down information silos instead of reinforcing them. Your reading habits belong to you. We don’t track, profile, or monetize your attention. You remain the customer and not the product.Community-driven sources: Our news sources are open source and community-curated through our public GitHub repository. Anyone can propose additions, flag problems, or suggest improvements. In your settings, you can select and reorder categories to match your interests and priorities. You can also adjust the number of stories shown, as well as dragging to re-order various sections, so that your briefing is focused on the depth and topics that matter most to you. You can choose your preferred interface and content language. News stories are generated in their original source language, and then translated using Kagi Translate. The default mode shows regional stories in their original language without translation, and all other ones in your browser’s language.Technical implementation that respects publishersWe don’t scrape content from websites. Instead, we use publicly available RSS feeds that publishers choose to provide. Publishers decide what content appears in their feeds; some include full articles, others only titles or summaries. We respect those choices completely. We’re working within the ecosystem publishers have created rather than circumventing their intentions.Ready to experience news differently?If you’re tired of news that makes you feel worse about the world while teaching you less about it, we invite you to try a different approach with Kagi News, so download it today:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Qualcomm Posts Initial Open-Source GPU Driver Patches For Adreno 800 Series</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Kernel-Adreno-800-Patches</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:04:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Qualcomm engineers have posted the initial patches for bringing up the newest Adreno 800 series graphics IP within the open-source MSM Linux kernel Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>We Finally Know What the Surface of Venus Looks Like</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZJfHBc4-0w</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XZJfHBc4-0w?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:00:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this Supercut, we’re exploring our deadly neighbour: Venus

--

The night of her son's birth, the queen of Calydon was visited by three shadowy goddesses, known as the Fates. They gestured towards the blazing hearth and decreed that her son would live only until the burning log was reduced to embers. Terrified, the queen locked the log in a chest and guarded the key— but the secret would loom over his life. Iseult Gillespie shares the Greek myth of Meleager.

This would allow Ukraine to hit targets deep inside of Russia like military facilities and oil and gas industries, which help fund its war. Kyiv’s new missile has a 20-foot wing span and can carry a one-ton warhead. For comparison, the U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missile has a wing span of under 9 feet.

Can we survive the heat death of the universe? One day, the last star will die, galaxies will dissolve, and black holes will evaporate. The universe becomes a cold, empty void where nothing happens. 
Forever. But there might be a loophole that lets life keep going.

Its probe was launched earlier this year, as part of the regulator's Children’s Code strategy, which is intended to set the standards for how online services handle the personal information of young people.In a statement the ICO said: “We are aware of reports that the social media platform Imgur is currently not available in the UK. Imgur's decision to restrict access in the UK is a commercial decision taken by the company.”Tim Capel, the ICO’s Interim Executive Director for Regulatory Supervision, said that the regulator had now issued a notice of intent to fine.He said: “We reached our provisional findings on this investigation, and we issued a notice of intent to impose a monetary penalty on MediaLab on 10 September 2025.“Our findings are provisional and the ICO will carefully consider any representations from MediaLab before taking a final decision whether to issue a monetary penalty.”The ICO also confirmed that companies could not avoid accountability by withdrawing their services in the UK.Mr Capel said: “We have been clear that exiting the UK does not allow an organisation to avoid responsibility for any prior infringement of data protection law, and our investigation remains ongoing.“This update has been provided to give clarity on our investigation, and we will not be providing any further detail at this time.”He added that protecting young people’s information remains a central focus: “Safeguarding children’s personal information is a key priority for the ICO and our Children’s code strategy outlines our key interventions in this area. Keeping children safe online is the responsibility of the companies offering online services to them and we will continue to hold them to account.”Regulators did not disclose the potential size of the penalty for specific breaches it has identified.Under UK law, the “notice of intent” process gives the company an opportunity to make representations before any final decision is made.Imgur, founded in 2009 and acquired by Los Angeles-based MediaLab AI Inc in 2021, is an image hosting and sharing site popular for memes, viral content and online communities. It’s services appeared to become unavailable in the UK last night.Imgur was approached for comment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Have We Reached a Space-Junk Tipping Point?</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/kessler-syndrome-space-debris</link><author>Margo Anderson</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTYxOTc0OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDkzOTM3Mn0.FTbVEh0o4dxBaetgxMC_-voIGZn5QRzV3mESmt0ybJQ/image.png?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[syndrome is already underway ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux&apos;s New &quot;Transitional&quot; Feature A Long Overdue Improvement For Kernel Configurations</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.18-Transitional</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 12:57:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Merged as part of the kernel hardening updates for Linux 6.18 is not a direct hardening improvement but rather a long overdue enhancement to the kernel configuration "Kconfig" system.

Some of these ghost towns are well-known, like Rhyolite, but others are just coordinates on a map — hidden like secrets to the true history of Nevada.

Vox video producer Dolly Li road tripped through northern Nevada to try and find some of these hidden ghost towns and learn about the real history behind the boom and bust cycles of mining in the state. Along the way, she stops by a town that many call a ghost town, but is still partially occupied by a dozen residents.

Through visiting a few abandoned mining towns and speaking to historians about the technology and infrastructure that made mining a key industry of the state, we piece together a rich and fascinating story of Nevada’s development.

We had a chance to speak to a lot of great experts and historians for this video. Here are some links to their work:

Tami Force’s website, Nevada Ghost Towns & Beyond, where she’s documented hundreds of ghost towns in the state:

For example, renaming a field, changing a response format, or changing an endpoint could stop someone’s production system from working correctly.Business requirements change, so it’s necessary to communicate the API adjustments clearly.That’s where  comes in. It provides a structured approach for evolving APIs without leaving the API consumers behind.She’s a software architect, Microsoft MVP, with a passion for distributed systems, .NET, and system design.Check out her blog and social media:You’ll find her speaking at developer conferences around the world and blogging online.API Versioning sets guidelines for introducing changes, shows how extensive those changes are, and ensures consumers can transition to new versions at their own pace.But here’s the catch: just adding a version number in the URL doesn’t automatically prevent all the problems.I’ve seen many APIs across different domains that expose a in their URLs.They add new data, change property names, change their types, remove fields, and so on. But years later, they run the same version even though the API has changed a lot.And many APIs end up  in the URL forever because the same organization controls the consumer apps as well.So why add a version at all?When different teams at the same company are the API owners and API consumers, version upgrades are “just” code changes. Teams can synchronize deployments, push breaking changes, and update consumers with little risk of breaking changes.However, when you expose the API publicly and don’t own the consumers, the scenario changes completely. It means you cannot simply break compatibility.Service Level Agreements ()…all of which force you to design carefully and communicate clearly.It’s better to avoid spending nights answering support calls because someone’s app broke when you changed an API endpoint.With Stream’s SDKs for React, React Native, Flutter, iOS, Android, and more, you can add production-ready , , , and  to your app—with just a few lines of code. Backed by a global edge network and a generous free Maker plan, start prototyping today and scale to millions.It’s helpful to think of APIs as contracts.The contract describes the shape of the data, the form of the endpoints, and the behavior of the API. The client and the provider both agree to this contract.However, the owner adds a new field when business requirements change or when they fix a bug. It means that API contracts change.And versioning is how we say:Here’s the old contract, still valid.Here’s the new contract, with improvements.There are three paths forward as the API evolves:1. Release a new version in a new locationThis means creating  while keeping  around.The users can use the old version as it is. And switch only when they want the new features. This approach is safe and straightforward for clients, but it creates a lot of work for the API owner.The API owner has to maintain several versions at the same time. For example, fix bugs, apply security updates, or implement features on all supported versions.Besides, this approach might become expensive and slow down future development.2. Release a backward-compatible versionIn this approach, the API changes in a way that doesn’t break existing clients.This means , such as including new fields, optional parameters, or endpoints in a response. As everything works the same way as earlier, consumers don’t have to update anything.This strategy allows gradual growth but might be limiting when large design shifts are necessary.In this scenario, the API changes require .Although it sounds like the worst option, sometimes it’s unavoidable. For example, there might be a need for a different data model, or a serious security flaw needs to be addressed. Or the original API design had issues they couldn't fix easily.In reality, we need a mix of all three, based on the change type and its impact.But before we go further, let’s understand these technical terms first:It means additive changes to an API without incrementing its version.You add new fields, parameters, or endpoints, but never remove or rename anything. It’s easy for consumers because they don’t have to change their integrations.It means acknowledging when a change breaks compatibility.You create a new version using a URL, header, or parameter. Thus making it possible to see old behavior in one version and new behavior in another.I’ll walk you through different approaches to explicit versioning of an API, their benefits, and their drawbacks next.This is one of the most common approaches.https://coolapi.com/api//ordersIt solves the problem of clarity and visibility because the consumer can easily understand which version they’re using by simply looking at the path.Thus making it easier for new consumers to follow documentation and configure routing logic.However, this clarity comes at the cost of stability. Here are some of its downsides:Maintaining many versions creates redundancy and overhead for the API owner.It pollutes URLs with version information.Although this approach looks simple to implement, here’s the challenge:Roy Fielding, the creator of REST, said that it represents evolvability. That means the ability to change how a resource looks or behaves without changing its identity. And Tim Berners-Lee said, “Cool URIs don’t change”. It means once you publish a URL, don’t change it. While people and systems should be able to rely on it forever.If we link those together, versioning the URL path might become unnecessary.So let’s just take a step back for a moment.A REST API represents resources.If  points to an order, it should always point to that order, even if the response structure changes.But adding  or  in the path () breaks the principle, because it treats the same thing (an order) as if it had two unique identities.The resource (an order) hasn’t changed into something else, but only its representation has changed.Here's how to best use path-based versioning:Keep older versions alive for a transition period.Announce clear deprecation timelines and provide migration guides.Use shared libraries for common logic so that bug fixes don’t need to be copied everywhere.Besides, HTTP itself provides mechanisms for communicating versioning and deprecation.Here are two of the most useful techniques:Sunset: Wed, 01 Jul 2026 00:00:00 GMTIt tells the consumers that the current version is scheduled to retire on 01 July 2026. And combining this with headers like , the client gets enough time to plan the migration.Redirects are another simple way to guide clients from one version to another.301 Moved Permanently

Location: /api/v2/ordersThis allows you to respond to a request with a 301 status code and a Location header, which specifies where the resource can be found.Thus helping the consumers who don’t update their code right away by guiding them to the newest version.But redirects work well when endpoints have changed only a little; otherwise, clients will need code changes.2. Query Parameter VersioningThis approach keeps the base URL stable and includes the version as a URL parameter.https://coolapi.com/api/orders?It solves the flexibility problem at the resource level.Here are some of its advantages:The API owner can version endpoints or even individual resources without changing the overall API structure.The consumer doesn’t have to update the base URLs, and different versions can coexist on the same path.But this approach has its downsides. Here are some of them:Many parameters can make it messy.Routers rely on paths, not query strings; so you’ll need custom logic in the gateway or application to handle different versions.Documentation has to be precise; otherwise, consumers may forget to include the query parameter and end up confused.Caching becomes difficult because of cache pollution, misconfiguration, or wrong cache hits.There’s a risk of consumers receiving the wrong version, as intermediate servers might ignore query parameters.Here are some best practices for query parameter versioning:Configure your CDN or cache to always include the query parameters in the cache key.Document the parameters in each example call and check their presence on the server side to avoid silent issues.Normalize query strings where possible to avoid duplicate cache entries. For example, treat ` and as the same.Although this approach gives you resource level control, it might complicate your codebase and caching strategy.3. Message Payload VersioningThis technique includes the version as part of the request and response body itself.{
  ,
  “data”: {
    “id”: 123,
    “status”: “shipped”
  }
}Payload versioning enables the management of long-lived data in asynchronous systems. It means the system stores the payload with version information for later replay in event-driven or queue-based architectures.You publish an event  to a queue.A service reads it right away or maybe 1 year later.Because the message includes the version, the service quickly understands which format (schema) to use for deserialization.However, this approach mixes concerns because versioning is part of business data.Besides, the consumer has to understand and process versions (schemas) correctly. This adds extra complexity for REST APIs with short request/response lifecycles.Here’s how to best use message payload versioning:Use it only for asynchronous or event-driven systems.Treat messages as fixed facts and create schema registries. This helps consumers safely de-serialize old formats.Only use payload versioning if you store and reuse messages later (like in queues or logs).For standard REST APIs, where responses are used immediately and then discarded, it just makes things harder.4. Header-Based VersioningThis approach passes the version information in the request headers.GET /api/orders

Another way is to version APIs through the  header.The client specifies the resource version by requesting a specific media type. This is known as Accept: application/vnd.example+json;api-version=2

Accept: application/vnd.github.v2+jsonThe API will then respond with the resource formatted for version 2 of the contract.Here are some advantages of header-based versioning:Allows clients to upgrade to new API versions at their own pace.Keeps URIs stable and self-describing.Aligns with HTTP semantics as metadata belongs in headers.However, this approach has its downsides. Here are some of them:Harder to debug, log, and cache as version information isn’t visible in the URL.Some proxies or middleware might strip or block custom headers if not set up properly.Besides, caching gets tricky when the version is in the  header.CDNs, reverse proxies, and browsers might not know that different headers mean different versions. To solve this, you add a header. It tells the cache to keep separate copies for each version and not to mix them up.Header-based versioning may look hard at first, but it’s the cleanest long-term choice.Your URLs stay stable, while versions are handled in headers. This keeps APIs consistent, avoids clutter, and follows REST principles. You need extra setup for caching, but the payoff is a smaller, easy-to-maintain API with less technical debt.Now that we’ve covered versioning types, let’s explore versioning formats.A versioning format is the way you label API versions to show what changed or when it changed.Semantic Versioning () uses the format . This helps to describe the changes included in a release.MAJOR: Breaking changes (clients must actively migrate).MINOR: Backward-compatible changes (new fields, endpoints).For example,  indicates the second major release, fourth minor, and first patch.This format gives consumers expectations:But 2.4 → 2.5 should be safe.Calendar versioning ()uses dates instead of numbers.Ubuntu 24.04: released in April 2024 (YY.MM). Python 3.12.20231001: released on 1 October 2023 (YYYYMMDD).This format tells you the release date, which makes it easier to track freshness rather than compatibility.Hash versioning () uses hashes (like Git commit IDs) instead of numbers or dates. It points to the exact state of the code at a specific time.v-237a2b4f: shortened Git commit hash of the build.This format is precise for traceability, but harder for humans to understand changes.It’s one thing to talk theory, but let’s look at how companies are designing their APIs: New accounts are automatically “pinned” to the latest version.Versions are in (CalVer) date-based format: Stripe-Version: 2023-10-16.Clients can override the version on a per-request basis to test or migrate.URLs stay clean as the versioning information lives in headers.Stripe’s approach makes upgrades safe and client-driven. This aligns well with the principle: don’t break your consumers without their consent.Also uses  with date identifiers (X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28).The base URL never changes: https://api.github.comThey support each version for , giving consumers time to migrate.Additive changes roll out to all versions; breaking changes trigger a new version.Keeps URIs stable, avoids version churn, and treats versions as snapshots in time.If the header is missing, the API defaults to the latest version.GitHub’s approach offers stable URLs and predictable migrations while reducing unnecessary versions. It highlights another philosophy: API as incremental snapshots in time.When to Increase the Version?There’s no fixed rule. Raise a new version only when the API contract changes meaningfully.How many consumers depend on this?Will the change break them?Do SLAs or legal obligations apply?Can you maintain many versions?Be pragmatic; don’t version every deployment. Do it only when the change affects consumers.Tooling for API VersioningVersioning isn’t just about design. It also needs tools for routing, documentation, and consistency.An API gateway manages traffic and routes requests to the correct services. It makes it easy to run different API versions in parallel.2. Documentation FrameworksDocumentation shows consumers which version they’re using and what changed.A documentation framework is a tool that helps you write and publish clear API docs so consumers know how to use different versions.You can publish documentation for both old and new API versions, and tools like Swagger will simply show what changed between them.Libraries reduce boilerplate and enforce consistent versioning across endpoints. It lets you define versions in routes or headers, and send requests to the right version of your API automatically.These tools don’t replace a strategy, but make it easy to manage versions at scale.When to Use Which StrategyThere’s no single “best” way to version APIs. Each strategy solves a unique problem.The right choice depends on your context:Path-based versioning: internal systems where you control all consumers.Query parameter versioning: resource-level flexibility, and can tolerate routing complexity.Header-based versioning: safest for external or long-lived clients you don’t control.Payload versioning: event-driven systems where messages are replayed later.And with version formats:SemVer: shows impact (breaking, additive, bug fix).CalVer: shows freshness (release).HashVer: shows traceability (commit or build).The additive strategy is good enough for most use cases.So pick the strategy that causes the fewest surprises to consumers. Stability and clear migration paths build trust. That trust is more valuable than any technical detail.👋 I’d like to thank Irina for writing this newsletter!It’ll help you become a better software engineer.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 170,001+ readers strong, very close to 172k.

If you’ve worked on legacy systems that were written by other people, perhaps decades ago, you’ll recognise this phenomenon. Before we can safely change code, we first need to understand it – understand what it does, and also oftentimes why it does it the way it does. In that sense, this is nothing new.What new is the scale of the problem being created as lightning-speed code generators spew reams of unread code into millions of projects.Teams that care about quality will take the time to review and understand (and more often than not, rework) LLM-generated code before it makes it into the repo. This slows things down, to the extent that any time saved using the LLM coding assistant is often canceled out by the downstream effort.But teams have opted for a different approach. They’re the ones checking in code nobody’s read, and that’s only been cursorily tested – if it’s been tested at all. And, evidently, there’s a of them.When teams produce code faster than they can understand it, it creates what I’ve been calling “comprehension debt”. If the software gets used, then the odds are high that  that generated code will need to change. The “A.I.” boosters will say “We can just get the tool to do that”. And that might work maybe 70% of the time. But those of us who’ve experimented a lot with using LLMs for code generation and modification know that there will be times when the tool just won’t be able to do it. “Doom loops”, when we go round and round in circles trying to get an LLM, or a bunch of different LLMs, to fix a problem that it just doesn’t seem to be able to, are an everyday experience using this technology. Anyone claiming it doesn’t happen to them has either been extremely lucky, or is fibbing.It’s pretty much guaranteed that there will be many times when we have to edit the code ourselves. The “comprehension debt” is the extra time it’s going to take us to understand it first.And we’re sitting on a rapidly growing mountain of it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Turbopuffer with Simon Hørup Eskildsen</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/09/30/turbopuffer-with-simon-horup-eskildsen/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=turbopuffer-with-simon-horup-eskildsen</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED5104125518.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 09:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Vector search has become a foundational technology for AI applications, enabling everything from semantic code search to contextual retrieval for large language models.

As I’m not big on goodbyes.Disqus started showing ads for their “free” tier comments system a few years back. At the time, the communication they sent out via email, seemed quite laid-back and had the tone of “don’t worry about it, it’s not a big thing”. Which in part lead me to almost forget it happened.At the time, the disqus comments system looked quite smart and sleek. I remember thinking that the ads system will possibly look smart and sleek too. Which alleviated any worries I had at the time.WELL…….I’ve just seen the ads, and they look horrific!!!I have a Pihole set up, so ads are blocked on my home network. When I’m out of the house, my phone is connected to a Wireguard VPN which routes my data through my home internet, therefore - getting all the ad-blocking, Pihole goodness.After years with Pi-hole, which now blocks over a million domains, I’ve become incredibly accustomed to a mostly ad-free web. Without realizing it, I’d forgotten what the typical internet experience feels like.I used to get a couple of emails from Disqus, letting me know that there’s a new comment on this blog. I haven’t had many of these emails recently, so I decided to disable my adblocker for a few minutes and check out the comments.There were none, instead I was greeted by some horribly formatted and obviously scammy ads:For the people who read this blog, I’m sorry.I became “blind” to what the web is really like for most users. I’ve tried to keep this blog minimalist - a clean place to find answers. Those ads not only ruin that experience; they trample privacy too:With this post, I’ve removed Disqus. It was making my blog worse, and frankly, they were profiting off my work and my visitor’s data.
I want this blog to be a resource for devs and technologists, free not just in money, but in freedom from unwanted tracking and invasive ads.I’m not entirely sure comments are needed here. There are other ways to reach me, for example; GitHub or Twitter/X. But having a place for discussion under each post can be valuable.
If you have any recommendations for alternative commenting systems (especially those that respect privacy or are self-hosted), I’d love to hear them! Please reach out if you’ve found something that works well.Thanks as always for reading - your trust matters to me.Sorry again for the mess!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Perf Characteristics of Userspace &amp; Kernel-Space Datapaths in Container Networking - DevConf.US 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgakOAnBdNw</link><author>DevConf</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zgakOAnBdNw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 08:31:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYAQDZIQGm_kPvemBc_qwg">Podcast - DevConfs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Speaker(s): Yanhui Ma

In OpenShift, the default container datapath is implemented using veth pairs connected to an OVS bridge, relying on kernel-space networking. With the introduction of DPDK and VDUSE (vDPA devices in userspace), OpenShift now not only offers a userspace datapath solution for container networking, but also unlocks the benefits of DPDK to containerized workloads—similar to the vhost-user solution used in traditional virtualized environments.
But what are the actual performance characteristics of the userspace datapath in OpenShift? And how does it compare to the kernel-space datapath?
In this talk, we will first present the technical architecture of the VDUSE OVS-DPDK userspace datapath solution we are implementing in OpenShift. We will then answer these questions by showcasing real-world benchmark results, focusing on key metrics such as latency, throughput, packets per second (PPS), among others.

In an increasingly hostile digital world, adopting Zero Trust security models has become a critical necessity for applications to be successful and secure. However, the complexity of implementing and monitoring a Zero Trust Architecture presents a significant challenge: how can non-security experts gain a clear and accurate understanding of their org's security compliance? 

The reality is that the detailed data from security assessments, often standardized but dense formats like the Open Security Control Assessment Language (OSCAL), is largely impenetrable to those without deep technical knowledge. Misunderstanding of this compliance status can lead to misinformed decisions and a false sense of security.

In this talk, you will be introduced to a visualization tool to address this problem. By transforming complex OSCAL assessment results into intuitive, interactive, and digestible visuals, this tool bridges the gap between complex technical data and product insight.

In 2024, inspired by the Mass Open Cloud (MOC), and in collaboration with the MOC Alliance (MOC-A), Red Hat Waterford and the Walton Institute at SETU collaborated and partnered in establishing an experimental cloud for researchers, staff and students in both organisations. These are the first steps in extending the MOC-A into Europe. Already, this private/public sector collaboration has created a community of new OpenShift and RHEL users with bare metal access. It has unblocked our work with partners on multiple Horizon EU projects. It has been made possible by recycling a super computer, installed in the liquid cooled Walton data centre, with operations provided by SETU, tech support for the ops team provided by Red Hat, and initial testing by the RH-OCTO team in Waterford. Positive interest around the project has attracted additional infrastructure in the form of storage funded by SETU, and an IBM Z LinuxONE mainframe.

As the online world continues to evolve, the intersection of Web3 and container solutions is creating a new era of decentralized cloud infrastructure. With their portability, scalability, and efficiency, containers are becoming the building blocks of choice for deploying and operating decentralized applications (dApps) and distributed computing environments in the Web3 world. By virtualizing infrastructure and offering uniform runtime environments, containers allow developers to build, deploy, and manage services across geographically dispersed nodes—a basic ability for decentralized systems.
There is a new trend here that comes with new and difficult security implications. Traditional security models depend on central control and fixed boundaries, which are not easily applicable to decentralized settings. In Web3 environments, where control, execution, and data are distributed, trust and integrity are much harder to ensure. Containers in such contexts introduce new kinds of threats, such as vulnerabilities in base images, insecure communication between nodes, and the threat of tainted containers impacting a bigger network of services.
This session will explain how containers are fueling the decentralized cloud in Web3, both its potential and risk involved in its security. It will also examine ways to address the risks, including cryptographic identity, zero-trust networking, secure orchestration, and immutable infrastructure. Everyone in attendance will learn about the best ways to protect, grow, containerized solutions in a very decentralized world and how to address the evolving threat landscape coming their way before it gets the better of them.

Real-time computing has a strict rule: correctness means producing the right output within a non-negotiable deadline. General-purpose OSes with their unbounded delays can't make this promise, which is why we rely on systems like the PREEMPT_RT kernel. Before this work, however, critical questions were left to guesswork: ""Have we tested long enough?"" and ""How do we know an even worse latency won't happen in production?""

This talk presents a toolkit that methodically answers these questions by applying Extreme Value Theory (EVT). Just as the Central Limit Theorem describes the behavior of averages, EVT provides the powerful statistical foundation for predicting extreme maximums. We'll show how this tool forecasts performance limits, helps diagnose deep-seated system bugs, and provides immense business value by turning uncertainty into data-backed confidence, enabling robust SLAs and de-risking system deployment.

In this talk, we’ll explore in detail about Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Arbitrary Command Execution attacks by diving into real-world vulnerabilities. I intend to explain how attackers exploit popular open source libraries through specific CVEs.

Vulnerabilities that we will look into: (See notes for detailed explanation)

- CVE-2024-47076: cups-filters: 
A vulnerability in CUPS allows attackers to exploit a flaw in how it processes print requests. By sending a malformed request, an attacker can trigger a memory issue, potentially leading to the attacker taking control of the system. 

- CVE-2024-6345: python-setuptools: 
Attackers can leverage weaknesses in the package_index module to run arbitrary code during package downloads, potentially compromising entire Python build environments. 

- CVE-2024-32002: git:
A vulnerability enables code execution during the cloning of local repositories, posing a risk to version control workflows.

This session includes a live demo showcasing an attack scenario in a controlled environment, providing attendees with practical insights into exploit execution.

Agile. Many engineers cringe at the word, associating it with overhead, planning, and formality—seemingly at odds with the flexibility needed to solve complex problems.

But what if I told you that you were actually born agile? I'm sure you’ll hate me, but stick around, and you might see I’m not that far off.

Agile isn’t just a business methodology; it mirrors how we naturally grow and learn. We start life without a plan, learning through trial, error, and support—just like our careers and projects. We iterate, refine, and adapt rather than having everything figured out from the start.

So why do engineers resist agile if it’s so innate? This talk explores that tension, uncovering how the same mentorship, collaboration, and continuous learning you grew up with can help teams move past frustration and fully embrace agility.

The company also revealed Claude Code 2.0, a command-line AI agent for developers, and the Claude Agent SDK, which is a tool developers can use to build their own AI coding agents.Anthropic says it has witnessed Sonnet 4.5 working continuously on the same project "for more than 30 hours on complex, multi-step tasks," though the company did not provide specific details about the tasks. In the past, agentic models have been known to typically lose coherence over long periods of time as errors accumulate and context windows (a type of short-term memory for the model) fill up. In the past, Anthropic has mentioned that previous Claude 4.0 models have played  for over 24 hours or refactored code for seven hours.To understand why Sonnet exists, you need to know a bit about how AI language models work. Traditionally, Anthropic has produced three differently sized AI models in the Claude family: Haiku (the smallest), Sonnet (mid-range), and Opus (the largest). Anthropic last updated Haiku in November 2024 (to 3.5), Sonnet this past May (to 4.0), and Opus in August (to 4.1). Model size in parameters, which are values stored in its neural network, is roughly proportional to overall contextual depth (the number of multidimensional connections between concepts, which you might call "knowledge") and better problem-solving capability, but larger models are also slower and more expensive to run. So AI companies always seek a sweet spot in the middle with reasonable performance-cost trade-offs. Claude Sonnet has filled that role for Anthropic quite well for two years now.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Peloton’s Robin Arzón Built a Successful Brand | The Deal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mlRBidTJxE</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/7mlRBidTJxE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 22:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of The Deal, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly talk with entrepreneur and Peloton head instructor Robin Arzón about how she built her own brand while also growing Peloton’s.

Be it DDOSing, AI scrapers,
etc. It’s a treadmill problem and no solution will ever be perfect, but we can
block many minimum effort attempts.I recently went down a coding rabbit hole. Packet filtering and analysis is a fascinating field.
There’s just a bone in my body that likes writing software at a scale that’s bigger than it’ll ever
be used. So how do you handle network requests fast? Well, write an operating system and custom
network drivers specifically optimized for speed. We won’t be doing that today, but we can get closer
to the bare metal fairly easily without sacrificing the Linux ecosystem. XDP - Express Data
Path is that way of getting closer to your network
device. And according to some benchmarks Wikipedia cites, you can drop 26 million packets per second
on consumer hardware. This is really good load handling, especially for a single server. Both Linux
and surprisingly Windows support XDP, but we’re just going to be focusing on Linux because that’s
what I have, and that’s what you’re going to read.So how do we actually write this?XDP works on eBPF - Extended Berkeley Packet Filter. We can just load our eBPF
filter, on to our network device with some XDP utilities, and our filter which will start taking in
all inbound requests. If we want we can also get our eBPF to pass our request back into the program
that loaded it in and do additional processing in userspace. This turns out to be ~400 lines of
boilerplate in C which you can read here. This isn’t a
tutorial, you can figure things out. That’s not the real interesting bit, the real magic happens on
the filter.8 billion devices run Java, and at least like a billion probably run eBPFs. eBPF is a tiny virtual
machine that hides in your kernel. You compile your code down to something that looks pretty low
level, you have your jumps and your registers and things you would expect, no SIMD, no x86 bloat but
it’s enough to have a decent  compilation target.So lets start to parse things out in a eBPF filter:There’s a couple oddities there that I’ll explain. The kernel won’t load the program if it’s not
GPL, so that’s required at the bottom. The  start and  variables just point to the start
and end of your full packet, starting with the Data Link layer, that’s Ethernet frames. The OSI
model you reluctantly learned in college is actually going to come in handy here because we have to
write our own network parser. The other weird thing is that we’re grabbing the data_end, why?
Because we need to validate our program. One of the benefits for this all running on a reduced
instruction set is that we can easily validate if the program can accidentally cause an out of
bounds read given some input, because your network driver crashing while trying to filter
bad packets seems like a pretty easy attack vector, especially since most of eBPF filters are written
in C.So here’s an example of this bounds check while we get our IP packet parsed.  comes
graciously from our kernel headers and we can quickly check if that struct fits into our full data
buffer before we start reading any values.So to fingerprint the client and determine whether or not a client is coming from curl we need to
parse the TLS packets. So once we just make sure everything looks good in TCP land, then if the
packet starts with the TLS handshake and the version we care about we can then start to get it’s
signature.So how do you fingerprint a TLS connectionI for the longest time was unaware of TLS fingerprinting, it’s probably that way intentionally
because once lots of people know about it, it’s not hard to get around it, but I have nothing to
hide so let me breakdown how we do this.The modern standard for TLS fingerprint is JA4 made by
FoxIO (no relation to me). The JA4 is just a string of some basic details about
the TLS connection, but it’s able to be traced back to your browser pretty easily. Here’s the full
explanation image that FoxIO provides:What you may notice in particular is that JA4 needs a SHA256 hash to work, if we’re going to
calculate this entirely in eBPF we’re going to need to introduce a ton of complexity. Because what I
found out pretty quickly when I starting implementing SHA256 in a filter is that it’s hard to get it
all to fit into the 512 byte stack space. So I started thinking, you could probably get it all in
by using tail calls, chaining together multiple eBPFs in sequence, but that’s just more work when
really the point here is just to shrink down the space needed to store all the ciphers. So why not
just use a non-cryptographic hash function here and cut down on program size? Using a
cryptographically secure hash really doesn’t provide any benefits because an attacker can already
just mimic another browser, no hash cracking needed. So here’s the spec for the new formatYou can read the official documentation here.Inside a TLS Client Hello, there’s just an arbitrary list of Cipher Suites. So what FST1 does and
the middle bit of JA4 does, is just parse them and hash them down. Each browser and HTTPS
implementation will use different ciphers, so we fingerprint that. And as an easy measure to avoid
storing duplicate lists of ciphers that are just in different orders we can sort the lists before
the hashing.The Jenkins hash is one of the simplest
hashing algorithms you can get, literally just add some numbers and shift the bits around a little.
Here’s what Wikipedia lists as a reference implementation.Now we also need to sort it, and that becomes trickier because I want to avoid making large arrays
that I would need to copy the Cipher Suites to on the tiny eBPF stack. So I embed the sorting
algorithm in the hashing function.Which is like a bastardized selection sort. The big O notation for it doesn’t look great being
O(n^2) but the major advantage is that we only need to store two numbers in memory other than the
hash. This is going to be more than enough for our use case here.Putting everything togetherMoving that into eBPF land we can pretty easily just tap into the ciphers,The  with the early returns is to keep the verifier happy, likewise with 
it yells at you for access the bytes raw even with bounds checking.So I have the implementation working, just grabbing a printout of each request’s hashes we can see
what userspace gives us matches what the filter gives us. So now that we can detect we can start
blocking! Pulling up Wireshark we can just get a dump of the Cipher Suites, calculate the hash and
store it in a configuration file. So now how do we actually get data from userspace to the kernel?
We could embed it in the binary but that heavily limits the amount of hash we can actually fit. The
solution is eBPF maps, we can pass data back and forth by using a helpfully provided kernel hash map.Surprising that we get a hash map here but not in native C, but I’m not complaining.The eBPF program can just look up the FST1 hash and if the value u8 is 1 and the key exists we can
then decide what to do with it. I just store a config value at the key of 0, so we can decide to
blacklist or whitelist any hashes that get activated.So that’s about it, I grabbed the hash of my curl client and created a config file with it
blacklisted. - After accidentally killing my server trying to update the kernel version, then
reinstalling everything - I can now just run the fox-filter program, and provided the curl exhibits the
same behavior as the curl that I installed with Arch Linux, the filter should block the request.This is of course overzealous to just block all curl requests, but with tools like
Anubis being largely ineffective. I think it’s fun to see bot
detection that can’t be bypassed by setting your user agent to(Yes this is real at the time of writing, try it out yourself)There’s ways to get around TLS signatures but it’s much harder and requires a lot more legwork to
get working, compounded even more if your forced to implement TLS extensions. It’s also a technique
that useful for passively viewing traffic patterns, and see when user agents lie.Pretty fast! With some preliminary benchmarks it seems to beat doing it in user space by a hair. All
of this is still pretty fast either way.Big thanks to Sakura from Papyrus Networks (sakura@voxga.xyz) for getting me interested in TLS fingerprinting.Shout out to FoxIO for documenting these techniques.Thanks to Nihaal for proofreading.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WWI Expert Breaks Down &apos;Blackadder Goes Forth&apos;</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmUsWN9yIBY</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/RmUsWN9yIBY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 19:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Huge thanks to KiwiCo for sponsoring today’s video!

It's the strongest model for building complex agents. It’s the best model at using computers. And it shows substantial gains in reasoning and math.Code is everywhere. It runs every application, spreadsheet, and software tool you use. Being able to use those tools and reason through hard problems is how modern work gets done.Claude Sonnet 4.5 makes this possible. We're releasing it along with a set of major upgrades to our products. In Claude Code, we've added checkpoints—one of our most requested features—that save your progress and allow you to roll back instantly to a previous state. We've refreshed the terminal interface and shipped a native VS Code extension. We've added a new context editing feature and memory tool to the Claude API that lets agents run even longer and handle even greater complexity. In the Claude apps, we've brought code execution and file creation (spreadsheets, slides, and documents) directly into the conversation. And we've made the Claude for Chrome extension available to Max users who joined the waitlist last month.We're also giving developers the building blocks we use ourselves to make Claude Code. We're calling this the Claude Agent SDK. The infrastructure that powers our frontier products—and allows them to reach their full potential—is now yours to build with.This is the most aligned frontier model we’ve ever released, showing large improvements across several areas of alignment compared to previous Claude models.Claude Sonnet 4.5 is available everywhere today. If you’re a developer, simply use  via the Claude API. Pricing remains the same as Claude Sonnet 4, at $3/$15 per million tokens.Claude Sonnet 4.5 is state-of-the-art on the SWE-bench Verified evaluation, which measures real-world software coding abilities. Practically speaking, we’ve observed it maintaining focus for more than 30 hours on complex, multi-step tasks.Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents a significant leap forward on computer use. On OSWorld, a benchmark that tests AI models on real-world computer tasks, Sonnet 4.5 now leads at 61.4%. Just four months ago, Sonnet 4 held the lead at 42.2%. Our Claude for Chrome extension puts these upgraded capabilities to use. In the demo below, we show Claude working directly in a browser, navigating sites, filling spreadsheets, and completing tasks.The model also shows improved capabilities on a broad range of evaluations including reasoning and math:Experts in finance, law, medicine, and STEM found Sonnet 4.5 shows dramatically better domain-specific knowledge and reasoning compared to older models, including Opus 4.1.The model’s capabilities are also reflected in the experiences of early customers:Our most aligned model yetAs well as being our most capable model, Claude Sonnet 4.5 is our most aligned frontier model yet. Claude’s improved capabilities and our extensive safety training have allowed us to substantially improve the model’s behavior, reducing concerning behaviors like sycophancy, deception, power-seeking, and the tendency to encourage delusional thinking. For the model’s agentic and computer use capabilities, we’ve also made considerable progress on defending against prompt injection attacks, one of the most serious risks for users of these capabilities.You can read a detailed set of safety and alignment evaluations, which for the first time includes tests using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, in the Claude Sonnet 4.5 system card.Claude Sonnet 4.5 is being released under our AI Safety Level 3 (ASL-3) protections, as per our framework that matches model capabilities with appropriate safeguards. These safeguards include filters called classifiers that aim to detect potentially dangerous inputs and outputs—in particular those related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons.These classifiers might sometimes inadvertently flag normal content. We’ve made it easy for users to continue any interrupted conversations with Sonnet 4, a model that poses a lower CBRN risk. We've already made significant progress in reducing these false positives, reducing them by a factor of ten since we originally described them, and a factor of two since Claude Opus 4 was released in May. We’re continuing to make progress in making the classifiers more discerning.We've spent more than six months shipping updates to Claude Code, so we know what it takes to build and design AI agents. We've solved hard problems: how agents should manage memory across long-running tasks, how to handle permission systems that balance autonomy with user control, and how to coordinate subagents working toward a shared goal.Now we’re making all of this available to you. The Claude Agent SDK is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code, but it shows impressive benefits for a very wide variety of tasks, not just coding. As of today, you can use it to build your own agents.We built Claude Code because the tool we wanted didn’t exist yet. The Agent SDK gives you the same foundation to build something just as capable for whatever problem you're solving.We’re releasing a temporary research preview alongside Claude Sonnet 4.5, called "Imagine with Claude".In this experiment, Claude generates software on the fly. No functionality is predetermined; no code is prewritten. What you see is Claude creating in real time, responding and adapting to your requests as you interact.It's a fun demonstration showing what Claude Sonnet 4.5 can do—a way to see what's possible when you combine a capable model with the right infrastructure."Imagine with Claude" is available to Max subscribers for the next five days. We encourage you to try it out on claude.ai/imagine.We recommend upgrading to Claude Sonnet 4.5 for all uses. Whether you’re using Claude through our apps, our API, or Claude Code, Sonnet 4.5 is a drop-in replacement that provides much improved performance for the same price. Claude Code updates are available to all users. Claude Developer Platform updates, including the Claude Agent SDK, are available to all developers. Code execution and file creation are available on all paid plans in the Claude apps.For complete technical details and evaluation results, see our system card, model page, and documentation.

This website enumerates every possible infohash (of which there around 10) and displays them on pages of32 at a time, for a total ofpages.BitTorrent clients can use a distributed hash table (DHT) to advertise themselves as a potential peer for a given infohash. When you load a page of infohashes, a DHT query is made for each of them to look for any advertising peers. If peers are found, another request is made to each to ask them for more metadata about the infohash, such as the name of the torrent and the files it contains.The chance of randomly finding an active infohash is very small, but not zero...* More accurately, every single torrent available to the DHT is on this website; clients can choose not to advertise themselves as peers in this way, and solely use tracker servers instead. This is often the case for ‘private’ torrents/trackers.Why do many torrents show a single peer, but never metadata?There is no validation that an infohash corresponds to a real torrent—any client can announce anything. Many crawlers and indexers continuously pick random or sequential infohashes and announce themselves so they can later detect other announcers, and malicious clients or poorly written bots can spam the network with anything they like.This is further confirmed by the observation that swathes of sequential infohashes all share the same single peer. Who is the mysterious ..? 5 points to the person who works out who it is flooding the DHT!It is also possible that a legitimate peer does not support the protocol extension required to exchange metadata.Why not check out my other site,Library of Babel, which contains every single book!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What made Vice so successful</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/s7D3GB5-4Bg</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/s7D3GB5-4Bg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 16:02:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are Cheetahs wearing sunglasses? 😎 #BigCatsPBS #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EQww3eWHFuc</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EQww3eWHFuc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 16:00:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cheetahs, daytime hunters, have dark color under their eyes which stops light from bouncing into their eyes and interfering with their vision.

And even today, ophthalmologists like myself struggle to address the idiosyncrasies of this organ when treating ocular and vision disorders.596 million peoplemost frequently performed$6,000as low as $150leading cause of blindnessabove 95 percentcataractMaharshi SushrutacouchingCouching entailed pushing the clouded lens (the cataract) into the vitreous chamber, or back portion of the eye, using a curved needle. Crucially, this procedure merely shifted the cataract away from the pupil to allow light into the eye, temporarily restoring limited sight without actually removing the cataract. Patients were often left with poor focus or blurred vision as a result.meticulous for its timethorns or metalThe surgeon then gently pushed or scraped the lens to move it out of the line of sight. The patient was asked to close the nostril opposite the treated eye and blow through the other, a technique believed to help expel the “phlegm” (kapha) from the eye.clarified butter (ghee)surgical methodsreferences to the treatment of cataractsCelsus describedevidence of sharp instruments from excavations acrossAmmar ibn Ali al-MawsiliMuntakhabfi ‘ilaj al-’aynThe Select Work on the Treatment of the EyeHis innovation marked a distinct conceptual evolution: the lens was no longer a part of the eye to be pushed aside, but a pathological entity requiring removal.Jacques Daviel, a French military surgeonTo appreciate the significance of this approach, it is important to understand the anatomy involved. During cataract surgery, the cloudy lens rests in front of the vitreous body, a clear, jelly-like substance filling most of the eye. The retina, responsible for vision, attaches to the back of the eye, behind the vitreous. If the posterior capsule is broken, the vitreous can move forward and disturb the delicate retina, increasing the risk of vision loss. By keeping the posterior capsule intact, the surgeon preserved both the vitreous and the posterior chamber, the space just behind the lens, thereby maintaining the eye’s natural structure and function. Daviel’s preservation of the posterior capsule is still followed in cataract operations today.Samuel Sharpintracapsular cataract extractiondetailed this procedurecareful to notePerhaps the largest “deficiency” of both Daviel and Sharp’s techniques was that patients who underwent them were left “aphakic,” with their natural lens gone and their vision blurred. With the help of thick convex spectacles, their sight was often clearer than it would have been with couching, but these glasses were bulky and still left the wearer with distorted sight and limited peripheral vision.dioptersSo while Daviel and Sharp recognized the importance of actually removing cataracts, they had not yet hit upon a means of replacement.Harold Ridleydesign for the first intraocular lens (IOL).found Elizabeth Attfield,waited three monthsAn implantation on a second patient in August 1950 resulted in a change of –15 diopters. After modifying the curvature of the artificial lens surface, which determines its focusing power, Ridley’s third IOL in November 1950 achieved a much more acceptable result of +4.5 diopters, closely matching the patient’s other eye.no suture was usedRidley waited for 18 months after his first IOL implantation before presenting his findings, hoping to showcase two-year follow-up results to prove the procedure’s safety and efficacy. However, an unexpected coincidence forced his hand. One of his patients, consulting the telephone directory for his post-operative visit, found a “Dr. Ridley” listed, made an appointment, and arrived at the address, only to discover he was at the office of Dr. Frederick Ridley, a different ophthalmologist. After this encounter, the news quickly spread.presented his workSir Stewart Duke-Elder, the doyen of British ophthalmologyobserved that he must have felt foolish“There he was, the greatest and most influential of all British ophthalmologists, the ‘ophthalmic Aladdin’ as he was sometimes called.

Kelman, an American ophthalmologisthimself fall to piecesThe hum of this scaler sparked an idea that would propel cataract surgery into its modern form: What if, he thought, a cataract could be emulsified — broken into tiny particles to be more easily removed from the eye?

However, we have plenty of meetings, colleagues asking us something in Slack, and lunch breaks. Add a colleague who comes to you and calls you for a cup of coffee if you work from the office.And usually, we don’t really have such a luxury as  of uninterrupted time.Nevertheless, sometimes we catch  of productive and focused work at the end of the workday. Imagine you come up with an elegant solution to a problem you’ve been tackling all day, or maybe even the whole past week. You can’t wait to implement and test your solution. And of course, you are so driven by your idea that you decide to continue working despite your working day being over. “20 minutes more and I will finish it,” you think. Obviously, this is not the case; some edge cases and new issues will inevitably arise. You come to your senses only 2–3 hours later—tired, hungry, demotivated, and still struggling with your problem. You just wasted your evening, with nothing to show for it. Worse, you overworked and didn’t recover that night. Thus, you were already exhausted when you started working.You can imagine what will follow next. Nothing good, really.I remember this happening back when I worked at a fast-growing startup, KazanExpress, while living in Innopolis. Our office was buzzing with energy, and the pace was intense—we often pushed ourselves late into the night. One evening, I felt like I had finally cracked a tricky part of our infrastructure. I thought, “Just 20 more minutes and I’ll finish it.” Of course, those 20 minutes stretched into well over three hours. By the time I left the office, I was tired, hungry, and frustrated—without any real progress to show. The next morning, walking back to the office, I realized how drained I already felt before even starting work. That was when it became clear to me: it’s better to stop, write down the next steps, and come back with a fresh head.Of course, some might argue, “But you are considering only a negative scenario; one could really finish that job in 20 minutes and go home happy…”. Sure, but I think this risk is not worth it. Instead, I would suggest doing another thing.Rather than trying to complete your task in 20 minutes, take this time to write down your thoughts, and a step-by-step action plan of what you think you need to do to finish your task. Then go home. Rest. A feeling of incompleteness will motivate you to come back and finalize your work the next day. Only you will be full of energy, together with a settled plan.

DESCRIPTION
Three experienced software engineers - Ian Cooper, David Whitney, and Hannes Lowette - discuss the evolution of software architecture from traditional "ivory tower" approaches to modern, collaborative practices. The conversation explores the tension between emergent and designed architecture, the importance of sustainable versus "slash-and-burn" development approaches, and how architectural decisions scale with organizational growth.
Key themes include the critical role of communication and coaching in architecture, the dangers of pattern cargo-culting, and the fundamental reality that all architectural challenges are ultimately people problems requiring empathy, shared language, and cultural change.

"Our students typically had five internship offers throughout their first four years of college," Farid said. "They would graduate with exceedingly high salaries, multiple offers. They had the run of the place. That is not happening today. They're happy to get one job offer...."

It's too easy to just blame AI, though, Farid said. "Something is happening in the industry," he said. "I think it's a confluence of many things. I think AI is part of it. I think there's a thinning of the ranks that's happening, that's part of it, but something is brewing..." 

Farid, one of the world's experts on deepfake videos, said he is often asked for advice. He said what he tells students has changed... "Now, I think I'm telling people to be good at a lot of different things because we don't know what the future holds." 
Like many in the AI space, Farid said that those who use breakthrough technologies will outlast those who don't. "I don't think AI is going to put lawyers out of business, but I think lawyers who use AI will put those who don't use AI out of business," he said. "And I think you can say that about every profession."

Just like someone taking photos on their holidays, or when out and about, I can see the fun in it.It is the “non-consensually publishing it online for the world to see” aspect which bugs me a bit.In the handful of games that I have played, no-one has ever asked about consent of other participants.There has been no “put on this purple lanyard if you don’t want to be included in the public version of the video” rule, which I’ve seen work pretty well at conferences I have attended (even if it is opt-out rather than consent).I could, I suppose, ask each person that I see with a camera “would you mind not including me in anything you upload, please?”. And, since everyone with whom I’ve spoken at games, so far anyway, has been perfectly pleasant and friendly, I’d be hopeful that they would at least consider my request. I have not done this.The impression I get is that this is just seen as part and parcel of the hobby: by running around in the woods of northern Newbury on a Sunday morning, I need to accept that I may well appear on YouTube, for the world to see.I don’t love it, but it is not a big enough deal for me to make a fuss.I occasionally see people saying “well, if you don’t want to be in photos published online, don’t be in public spaces”.This is nonsense, for a number of reasons. Clearly, one should be able to exist in society, including going outside one’s own home, without needing to accept this kind of thing.In any case, here, the issue is somewhat different, since it is a private site, where people engage in private activity (a hobby).But then I’ve seen the same at (private) conferences, with people saying “Of course I’m free to take photos of identifiable individuals without their consent and publish them online”.Publishing someone’s photo online, without their consent, without another strong justification, just because they happen to be in view of one’s camera lens, feels wrong to me.This isn’t about what is legal (although, in some cases, claims of legality may be poorly conceived), but around my own perceptions of a private life, and a dislike for the fact that, just because one  publish such things, that one .[Updated] Some more notesI’m just blogging. Sharing my thoughts. I’m not trying to set anyone’s policy, demand that anyone takes anything down or stops doing anything, or change anyone’s view.I am in the UK. Different places may well have different norms, laws, and expectations. But this is just about something which bugs me a bit, not what the legal rights and wrongs might be. Plus, I don’t think that anyone (that I’ve seen so far) is doing this meanly or nefariously. This is just part of the fun for them, and fun is important.Yes, biodegradable BBs are available, although it is not a site requirement, and the site shop does not sell them. I have used them a couple of times, and I haven’t found them to shatter on impact as much as (non-biodegradable) tracer BBs. I tend to buy BBs from the site’s own shop, to support them.Yes, I wear two-part face covering; goggles/glasses (depending on the heat and humidity), and a lower face and ear mask. I prefer this to a full face mask. But players are still pretty obviously distinguishable, given differences in loadouts, patches they wear, and people shouting names.

has provided a safe and secure haven for Android users around the world to
find and install free and open source apps. When contrasted with the
commercial app stores — of which the Google Play store is the most prominent
— the differences are stark: they are hotbeds of spyware and scams,
blatantly promoting apps that prey on their users through attempts to
monetize their attention and mine their intimate information through any
means necessary, including trickery and dark
patterns.F-Droid is different. It distributes apps that have been validated to work
 the user’s interests, rather than for the interests of the app’s
distributors. The way F-Droid works is simple: when a developer creates an
app and hosts the source code publicly somewhere, the F-Droid team reviews
it, inspecting it to ensure that it is completely open source and contains
no undocumented 
such as advertisements or trackers. Once it passes inspection, the F-Droid
build service compiles and packages the app to make it ready for
distribution. The package is then signed either with F-Droid’s cryptographic
key, or, if the build is
reproducible, enables
distribution using the original developer’s private key. In this way, users
can trust that any app distributed through F-Droid is the one that was built
from the specified source code and has not been tampered with.Do you want a weather app that doesn’t transmit your every
movement
to a shadowy data broker? Or a scheduling assistant that doesn’t siphon
your intimate
details
into an advertisement network? F-Droid has your back. Just as sunlight is
the best disinfectant against corruption, open source is the best defense
against software acting against the interests of the user.Google’s move to break free app distributionThe future of this elegant and proven system was put in jeopardy last month,
when Google unilaterally
decreed
that Android developers everywhere in the world are going to be required to
register centrally with Google. In addition to demanding payment of a
registration fee and agreement to their (non-negotiable and ever-changing)
terms and conditions, Google will also require the uploading of personally
identifying
documents,
including government ID, by the authors of the software, as well as
enumerating
all the unique “application identifiers” for every app that is to be
distributed by the registered developer.The F-Droid project cannot require that developers register their apps
through Google, but at the same time, we cannot “take over” the application
identifiers for the open-source apps we distribute, as that would
effectively seize exclusive distribution rights to those applications.If it were to be put into effect, the developer registration decree will end
the F-Droid project and other free/open-source app distribution sources as
we know them today, and the world will be deprived of the safety and
security of the catalog of thousands of apps that can be trusted and
verified by any and all. F-Droid’s myriad users will be left adrift, with no
means to install — or even update their existing installed —
applications. (How many F-Droid users are there, exactly? We don’t know,
because we don’t track users or have any registration: “No user accounts,
by design”)While directly installing — or “sideloading” — software can be construed as
carrying some inherent risk, it is false to claim that centralized app
stores are the only safe option for software distribution. Google Play
itself has
repeatedlyhosted
malware, proving that corporate gatekeeping doesn’t guarantee user
protection. By contrast, F-Droid offers a trustworthy and transparent
alternative approach to security: every app is free and open source, the
code can be audited by anyone, the build process and logs are public, and
reproducible builds ensure that what is published matches the source code
exactly. This transparency and accountability provides a  basis
for trust than closed platforms, while still giving users freedom to
choose. Restricting direct app installation not only undermines that choice,
it also erodes the diversity and resilience of the open-source ecosystem by
consolidating control in the hands of a few corporate players.Furthermore, Google’s framing that they need to mandate developer
registration in order to defend against malware is disingenuous because they
 have a remediation mechanism for malware they identify on a
device: the Play Protect
service that is
enabled on all Android Certified devices already scans and disables apps
that have been identified as malware, regardless of their provenience. Any
perceived risks associated with direct app installation can be mitigated
through user education, open-source transparency, and existing security
measures without imposing exclusionary registration requirements.We do not believe that developer registration is motivated by security. We
believe it is about consolidating power and tightening control over a
formerly open ecosystem.If you own a computer, you should have the right to run whatever programs
you want on it. This is just as true with the apps on your Android/iPhone
mobile device as it is with the applications on your Linux/Mac/Windows
desktop or server. Forcing software creators into a centralized registration
scheme in order to publish and distribute their works is as egregious as
forcing writers and artists to register with a central authority in order to
be able to distribute their creative works. It is an offense to the core
principles of free speech and thought that are central to the workings of
democratic societies around the world.By tying application identifiers to personal ID checks and fees, Google is
building a choke point that restricts competition and limits user
freedom. It must find a solution which preserves user rights, freedom of
choice, and a healthy, competitive ecosystem.Regulatory and competition authorities should look carefully at Google’s
proposed activities, and ensure that policies designed to improve security
are not abused to consolidate monopoly control. We urge regulators to
safeguard the ability of alternative app stores and open-source projects to
operate freely, and to protect developers who cannot or will not comply with
exclusionary registration schemes and demands for personal information.If you are a developer or user who values digital freedom, you can
help. Write to your Member of
Parliament,
Congressperson
or other representative, sign petitions in defense of sideloading and
software freedom, and
contact the
European Commission’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) team to express why
preserving open distribution matters. By making your voice heard, you help
defend not only F-Droid, but the principle that software should remain a
commons, accessible and free from unnecessary corporate gatekeeping.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The First Trains</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-first-trains</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/68d6bd8a730cf5a7475a4fc9/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=nXbOnzysUKgiNAIkCdeuF7teK0y9_ls9m2Ow0968eBw" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Play snake in the URL address bar</title><link>https://demian.ferrei.ro/snake/</link><author>macote</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 21:08:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Dark Secrets Of The Tudor Court: The Fall Of Anne Boleyn</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgT1x6RD9xI</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wgT1x6RD9xI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 21:01:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the 2nd episode of "Anne Boleyn: Arrest, Trial, Execution," historian Tracy Borman chronicles the events of Anne's trial for adultery and treason in May 1536. The trial, orchestrated by Thomas Cromwell, was a spectacle designed to guarantee a guilty verdict, with Anne's own uncle and father on the jury. Despite a strong and dignified defense against the flimsy evidence, Anne was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death. Her conviction and impending execution were sealed by the prior conviction of the five men she was accused of having affairs with, a verdict that was almost certainly the result of torture and coercion. The trial is presented as a gross miscarriage of justice, serving King Henry VIII's desire to marry Jane Seymour and remove Anne permanently.

Our kernel can aggressively overlap compute, memory, and communication ops in order to simultaneously use the different hardware resources available on a GPU. When integrated into the Tokasaurus inference engine, our megakernel can outperform SGLang by  on end-to-end throughput (measured as time to finish 65,536 prompts from the ShareGPT benchmark). We're releasing the code here; please be warned that this  is research code; it is sensitive to compiler versions, GPU setup, and sometimes even being looked at the wrong way, and we have no intention whatsoever of supporting it. We hope you'll find the ideas and results interesting nonetheless!A few months ago, we showed how we could fuse an entire model forward pass into a single "megakernel" in order to deliver low-latency inference with Llama-1B. In that post, we teased that many of the same concepts we introduced would also be useful for optimizing for throughput. We're now excited to bring receipts and release a new megakernel optimized for high-throughput inference with Llama-70B.The inference workloads targeted by our low-latency and high-throughput megakernels are quite different and require distinct optimizations. Our low-latency megakernel targeted inference using Llama-1B when running on a single GPU with batch size one. This workload was entirely memory bound, and our focus was therefore on eliminating stalls that delayed loading model weights from global memory.With large-batch Llama-70B inference, our workload is much more heterogeneous. Large portions of it (e.g. matrix multiplies, attention prefill) are compute-bound. Other parts (e.g. attention decode, RMS norm) are still bottlenecked by global memory bandwidth. Additionally, by distributing our model across multiple GPUs, we now need to perform cross-GPU communication that throttles the NVLink connections between devices. By running these components sequentially, we've paid for the whole GPU, but are only using little bits and pieces of it at a time. :(Overall, these different operations in our model each make use of different resources available on the GPU (e.g. tensor cores, non-matmul compute units, HBM bandwidth, NVLink bandwidth) in unique ways. Therefore, a key area for optimizing this high-throughput workload is to overlap multiple kinds of work in order to simultaneously use more of the GPU's resources. We want to do this across many levels of the GPU -- within an individual SM, across multiple SMs, and even across GPUs.In the rest of this blog, we will:Give a brief recap on the design of our megakernels from our last, low-latency post.Walk through the details of the tensor-parallel Llama forward pass that we map into our megakernel, including a novel approach to communicating intermediate results across GPUs right after running attention. This new operation requires a complicated multi-GPU transpose not efficiently expressable with standard communication patterns, but is trivial to implement within the megakernel!Show how megakernels can achieve fine-grained resource overlapping at multiple levels of the GPU hierarchy: within individual SMs, across multiple SMs, and across multiple GPUs!Within individual SMs, the same inter-instruction pipelining we used in low-latency llama can also help keep overlap memory movement and compute across instructions, thereby keeping the tensor cores running.Across multiple SMs, careful scheduling of instructions can overlap both compute-intensive (e.g. matrix multiply) and memory-intensive (e.g. RMS norm) kinds of work at once, on an individual GPU.Across GPUs, we can hide communication costs within special "storer" threads, leaving other threads free to do work on the next instruction while communication happens in the background.Finally, we put it all together by benchmarking our megakernel against vLLM and SGLang.Megakernels: A Brief RecapIn our last post, we wrote our first full-model megakernel in order to optimize a low-latency scenario: running inference with Llama-3.2-1B and batch size one. We discovered that popular inference engines like vLLM and SGLang were only using about half of the available GPU bandwidth on an H100. The problem is that traditional systems break down model forward passes into dozens or hundreds of separate kernels, each with setup and teardown periods where no useful work gets done. These overhead periods create "memory pipeline bubbles" where an SM (i.e. a streaming multiprocessor, one of the compute subunits on a GPU) sits idle instead of loading model weights. Our solution to this was to merge the entire Llama-1B forward pass into a single fused "megakernel" that eliminates kernel boundaries altogether. We found that on small models, our megakernel could provide per-user throughput around 50% higher than inference frameworks like SGLang and vLLM.The core abstraction behind our megakernel lays in an instruction-and-interpreter model. Instead of decomposing a model forward pass into a series of coarse-grained kernels, we instead decomposed it into a sequence of fine-grained . Instructions can have distinct types, loosely corresponding to the kinds of kernels one would use in conventional implementations (e.g. matrix multiply, attention prefill, RMS norm). Each instruction specifies a unit of work that would traditionally be performed by a thread block, e.g. compute an output tile for a matrix multiplication. Furthermore, each instruction is organized into dedicated sections, e.g. a load function that reads from global memory, a compute function, and a store function that writes out results. We execute these instructions using an on-GPU interpreter. When the megakernel launches, each SM initializes an interpreter and starts executing a sequence of instructions (these sequences are  into per-SM queues ahead of time). A key feature of these interpreters is that they can aggressively pipeline across instruction boundaries, starting tasks for the next instruction (e.g. loading model weights) while the current instruction finishes. For our low-latency megakernel, this let us eliminate most of the memory bubbles between operations. For more details on the interpreter design (e.g. how we manage shared memory across instructions, how we synchronize different SMs), see the original blog post and the codebase.In this blog, we'll focus on a high-throughput workload with very different performance considerations than our previous Llama-1B target. However, as we'll describe below, this same core instruction/interpreter abstraction will be extremely helpful for achieving high throughput.First, we'll start with a brief walkthrough of the operations needed to perform a large-batch forwards pass using tensor-parallel Llama-70B. Specifically, we implement the "sequence parallel" variant of TP, where some operations are performed data-parallel (i.e. each GPU holds full activation vectors for a slice of the tokens in a batch) and some operations are performed tensor-parallel (i.e. each GPU holds a slice of the activation vectors for all tokens). Concretely, with sequence parallelism each transformer block receives a data-parallel chunk of the hidden states (i.e. the full hidden states for a subset of tokens) as input and performs the following operations:Data-parallel pre-attention RMS norm.All-gather (i.e. each GPU collects the activations from all other GPUs, so that each GPU now has the activations from all tokens).Tensor-parallel QKV projections, attention, and O projection (each GPU is responsible for a subset of attention heads).Data-parallel post-attention residual connection and pre-MLP RMS norm.Post-MLP residual connection.However, we've made one important change to this formulation. One of our targets for operation overlapping is to overlap the O projection matrix multiplication with the subsequent reduce-scatter. However, the tensor-parallel sharded O matrix is too small for us to effectively hide the reduce-scatter communication cost. To solve this, we instead choose to replicate the O projection matrix across each GPU and run the O projection with data parallelism instead of with tensor parallelism. Alongside this change, we eliminate the post-attention reduce-scatter and replace it with a "distributed transpose" operation after attention that repartitions our data from a tensor-parallel configuration to a data-parallel configuration.When using 8 GPUs, this reduces the network traffic by a factor of 8, which makes it much easier to hide the cost of communication cost by overlapping it with matrix multiplications. Note that the downside of this approach is it reduces the maximum batch size by about 15%, because replicating the O projection weights consumes an additional 9 GB of memory per GPU.Defining our Megakernel Instruction SetWith our parallelism scheme decided on, we are able to construct the instruction set for our high-throughput megakernel. We partition our workload into the following fused instructions:A QKV matrix multiply + RoPE.Attention + distributed transpose.O-projection matrix multiply + residual.Gate matrix multiply + SiLU.Up-projection matrix multiply + elementwise multiplication with the output of the gate.Down matrix multiply + reduce-scatter + residual.RMS norm without the all-gather (for the LM head)Relative to our latency-focused Llama-1B megakernel, this instruction set contains several high-level changes in our approach:Most of our instructions for low-latency centered around matrix-vector multiplication, rather than the matrix-matrix multiplications we do here. The optimal work partitioning for these two operations is generally completely different. For matrix-vector products, each instruction computes several complete columns of the output vector. However, in matrix-matrix products, each instruction computes a  of the output matrix instead.To avoid extra trips to global memory, for our low-latency megakernel we frequently recomputed results across the GPU rather than communicating them through memory. This allowed us to fuse operations more aggressively than usual. For example, our QKV matrix-vector product fused the RMS norm into its beginning, saving an instruction boundary, but performing identical RMS computations over a hundred times. When focusing on throughput, this recomputation is not worth it.Putting many tokens in our batch requires us to expand our inter-instruction signalling scheme [link to relevant section in llama-1b post] to track data dependencies across tokens. This signalling can vary by instruction -- for some operations (e.g. attention, RMS norms), sometimes synchronization is at the granularity of 128 output rows of a matrix; other times it's at the granularity of an individual attention head for an individual token.Overlapping Resources Within a MegakernelOur primary goal when optimizing forward pass for throughput is to overlap hardware resources (e.g. use as much GPU memory bandwidth, compute units, and interconnect bandwidth as possible). Below, we show that our megakernel allows us to do this at three levels of hierarchy: within an SM by overlapping the stages of different instructions, across SMs by running different instructions, and across GPUs by overlapping communication with other work.Overlapping within the SMWithin individual SMs, we make use of our megakernel template's instruction pipeline (previously described here) to overlap loading weights and activations for the next instruction with performing compute for the previous instruction. Even though our objective is now throughput, it's still useful to be able to start loading the next data in advance -- to keep matrix multiplies running as quickly as possible.Within the SM, our interpreter specializes threads to different functions: each of the load, compute, and store functions within the instruction template is executed by its own, independent set of threads. This means that even while a compute or store is running, the loads for the next matrix multiplies can start as soon as possible.To help understand this, we've written profiling tools that make it easier to see what's going on here. Figure 2, below, shows the brief transition between two different kinds of instructions on a single SM -- the Gate SiLU instruction (brown) and the Up matmul instruction (pink). If you'd like to build a better intuition for the profiler, you can access it here, alongside an example profile to download and play with.Figure 2: A zoomed-in snapshot of a single SM across about 15 microseconds, as it transitions from a Gate SiLU instruction to an Up matmul instruction.First, a quick tutorial on how to read what's going on in this zoomed-in profile snapshot:The three horizontal tracks represent different kinds of threads within the interpreter that runs instructions.At the top are the loader threads, which pull data from global memory into shared memory.The thick band in the middle represents consumer threads that perform the main work -- in this case, running the tensor cores.The bottom row tracks storer threads, which store results from shared memory back up to global memory.Finally, in the background are controller threads that help coordinate the interpreter, although they're not programmed by the user.Different colored bars represent different kinds of instructions. In this case, the brown bars on the left correspond to the Gate SiLU instruction, and the pink bars on the right correspond to the Up matmul instruction.Thin vertical lines represent different kinds of events. For example, blue and cyan lines correspond to different kinds of loads being issued. Purple lines represent the beginning of a compute phase, and yellow and orange lines correspond to different kinds of stores. Finally, red lines represent wait events, and green lines represent ready states. In general, we have instructions only report events from the first 8 and last 4 stages, since we have limited timing slots.Tall vertical lines in the background represent events happening within the controller warp of the interpreter. The salmon line tells the SM to fetch the next instruction, the pale green line indicates that the next instruction is set up, and the white line indicates the last instruction has finished and can now be torn down.Here's a complete timeline of this little snapshot.Starts issuing loads for last four stages of matrix multiply pipeline (128 x 64 x 256).Dark blue lines = A matrix loads, cyan lines = B matrix loads (300ns later)Signals controller to begin setting up next instruction (after fourth-to-last load)Begins running fourth-to-last matrix multiply (associated with first load)Finishes setting up next Up matmul instruction, entailing fetching and decoding instruction,
setting up semaphores, and remapping shared memory pages.Begin running dependency check before loading inputs.Finish running matrix multiplies, begin storing results into two unreleased shared memory pagesResolves dependency check, and issues loads for first 2.5 stages, before stalling due to lack of available shared memory pages.Receives results, launches asynchronous store to global memory.Consumer threads start Up matmul matrix multiplies while shared memory still in useBegins running matrix multiplies on Up matmul instruction.First store finishes reading from shared memory, releases one page.Loader threads restart load pipeline.Final store finishes reading from shared memory, releases last page to Up matmul instruction.Up matrix multiply pipeline completely unblocked for the rest of the instruction.Asynchronous stores to global memory complete.Atomically increments flag in global memory signifying instruction completion.Notified all threads completed instruction work.Begins teardown, invalidating previous instruction semaphores, and writing timing data to global memory.Now let's contrast this with a snapshot with the instruction pipeline disabled.Figure 3: The exact same profile, but with no inter-instruction pipelining.In this ablated profile, the store must finish, instruction be torn down, next instruction set up, and memory loaded, before matrix multiplies can begin again. Whereas with instruction pipelining enabled, the extra gap between consecutive matrix multiply stages is just 3.4 microseconds, without the pipeline, this gap jumps to 10.2 microseconds -- meaning this optimization alone reduces runtime by over 7% on these instructions.Nor is this effect isolated to the boundary of these two particular instructions; it shows up everywhere. In Figure 4, we take a look at some zoomed out profiles showing all 8 GPUs, and we'll use similar profiles for other ablations in the rest of this post, so it's worth understanding this profile well.Figure 4: Block profiles of pipelined versus serial instruction execution. Serial execution has a lot more gaps!What we're looking at here represents a little over two full transformer blocks of a Llama-70B forward pass with a batch size of 8,192, across all 8 GPUs. Unlike the zoomed-in view, where each SM separates into three separate bars, each horizontal bar here just represents the activity of the consumers for that SM. And, as before, each different color represents a different kind of instruction. From left to right:Blue represents the Attention RMS norm and all-gather.Orange represents the QKV matrix multiply.Green represents the attention and inter-GPU transpose.Red represents the O-projection matrix multiply.Purple represents the MLP RMS norm and all-gather.Brown represents the Gate SiLU.Pink represents the Up matrix multiply.Grey represents the Down projection matrix multiply.We also lightly shade the background to make it easier to distinguish SMs on different GPUs: if you look closely you should see light color bands to help make this visible.In the case of figure 4, the pipelined profile runs at 31,516 decoding TPS for this particular test workload (Prefill "tell me a funny joke about cookies", 30 decode tokens -- we have absolutely cornered the market on efficiently generating short cookie jokes), whereas the serial profile runs at just 29,607 TPS, corresponding to a difference of over 6%. This difference turns out to persist across different batch sizes, and generally provides around 2-6% end to end MFU, as shown in the table below.Best config minus pipeliningTable 1: Decoding TPS Generating Short Cookie Jokes at Various Batch Sizes, with and without PipeliningAs a final note of this section, relating to the profiling itself, one might reasonably ask what overhead generating these plots incurs. It turns out to be very little: across 32 separate experiments we ran in the course of writing this post, we measured each runtime with and without generating timing data, each of which is a separate compilation path. We found the average difference to be just 0.39%, with a maximum of 1.07%. So, although timing may introduce a small amount of distortion, we think that this data is overall quite reliable. All TPS numbers are reported without timing recording enabled.With our low-latency megakernel, each SM was assigned its own queue of instructions that are scheduled in advance. Instead, for our high-throughput megakernel, we create a global work queue -- a single list of instructions that defines all the work that needs to run on the GPU. When an SM needs to fetch a new instruction to run, it atomically increments a global instruction counter that keeps track of the next instruction to be assigned. This approach is automatically robust to jitter in the execution across different SMs; if one SM is slow to finish its instruction relative to others, it will simply delay its request for new work, allowing other SMs to pick up the slack. This solution wasn't possible for our low-latency megakernel, because the runtime of each instruction was so fast that the latency of this atomic increment would be prohibitive. But with a throughput-oriented megakernel -- where individual instructions frequently take 100 microseconds or more -- this cost can be entirely hidden as part of our instruction pipeline.Figure 5: Ablating the global work queue. On top, we use the global work queue. On the bottom, we use a simple round robin scheduler to assign work. The global work queue effectively smooths out variances in runtime that are present in the round-robin scheduler.In figure 5, we ablate the global work queue by replacing it with a simple round-robin scheduler, and find a 14.2% end-to-end reduction in performance at a batch size of 8,192. A broader report is provided in table 2.Table 2: Decoding TPS Generating Short Cookie Jokes at Various Batch Sizes, with and without the Global Work QueueAs one can see from table 2, the global work queue becomes useful at large batch sizes, where there is enough that work that jitter across SM's becomes important, and eliminating that jitter with dynamic scheduling makes a big difference. At very small batch sizes, the overhead in the global work queue actually outweighs its benefit.Finally, it's worth noting that the global work queue is not the only way to improve scheduling over a naive round-robin scheduler; many other schedulers might work well. However, static schedulers cannot adapt to runtime jitter in the same way that the global work queue does; the variance in runtime across GPUs in figure 5 (despite them having nearly identical schedules) suggests that this jitter is a major factor.In order to implement our tensor-parallel Llama, we need to be able to exchange data between GPUs. In general, NVIDIA gives us two ways to do this. One common approach is to use the GPU's copy engines -- dedicated hardware for copying big, contiguous chunks of memory within or across devices. One advantage of using the copy engines is that these copies don't need to run within a kernel, freeing up the GPU's SMs to do other useful work! By using multiple cuda streams, we can launch copy engine operations that overlap with kernel computations (e.g. as is done in PyTorch's AsyncTP).The other way to transfer data between GPUs is to do so  a kernel, using the GPU's SMs to write data into remote memory on other GPUs via CUDA's unified memory architecture (thanks Bill!) We've added a corresponding new abstraction to ThunderKittens called the Parallel Global Layout (PGL). With PGLs, we perform asynchronous loads and stores directly to global memory on other devices, overlapping them with compute and local memory operations to achieve near-zero cost. We also leverage NVSwitch's central accelerator to offload collective operations to hardware outside the GPU. Read more about PGLs and our multi-GPU approach in our earlier blog post.In our megakernel we use the second approach, because it gives us the control we need to perform all-gathers, reduce-scatters, and our post-attention distributed transpose (which allows us to do the O-projection in data-parallel form). We perform all communication from our dedicated storer threads, allowing loader and compute threads to move onto future work while inter-GPU communication is performed in the background on the same SM.Warp specialization, instruction pipelining, and the global work queue now give us a way to overlap different hardware resources within an SM. However, we can further benefit from GPU resource overlapping if we can assign different types of instructions to different SMs.For example, with a large batch size, tokens at the beginning of the batch will have their compute-bound Down projections completed earlier than tokens at the end of the batch. This makes these early tokens ready to start the next instruction, which is the network-bound pre-attention RMS norm and all-gather. If we run that RMS norm and all-gather for these early tokens on some SMs, while computing the Down projection for the later tokens on different SMs, we can reduce peak network bandwidth and better exploit the hardware resources available on the device.Some prior work, like NanoFlow, implemented this technique on A100s by constructing a schedule ahead-of-time that assigns SMs to different groups, namely compute-focused SMs that compute matmul-heavy ops, memory-focused instructions that compute attention decoding, and comms-focused SMs that communicate results across devices. With our megakernel, we can perform this overlapping at a much finer granularity by interleaving instructions from different ops into our global work queue. Once we have scheduled enough Down projection instructions for some tokens to be ready for attention, we can start interleaving RMS norm instructions while we add the remaining Down projection instructions into our schedule. This interleaving lets different SMs run different kinds of work without needing to explicitly assign SMs to groups like in NanoFlow.Figure 6: Ablating interleaving. On top, we use our standard interleaved schedule. On the bottom, we disable interleaving. Notice how the two RMS norms (purple and blue) are no longer quilted the same way, but instead take up 200-300 microseconds each time they come up. (Note that although QKV and Gate SiLU instructions may begin early, they rely on many RMS norms to satisfy their dependencies, and usually start after all of the RMS norm instructions are finished.)The effect of the interleaving is easy to see in our profiles, since it creates "quilts" (i.e. dense multi-colored regions where different SMs are running different kinds of instructions at a given point in time).Best config minus interleavingTable 3: Decoding TPS Generating Short Cookie Jokes at Various Batch Sizes, with and without InterleavingAs one can see from table 3, interleaving also kicks in at large batch sizes (like the global work queue), where there is enough work on the GPU to allow several waves of instructions of each type, and therefore the effective interleaving of those waves. At these large batch sizes, it's just as important of an optimization as intra-SM pipelining.The key advantage of our approach is that it eliminates the overhead of additional kernel launches and cross-stream synchronization. We also note that we've removed our reliance on NCCL entirely, continuing in our march towards Obadiah Stane's paragon of minimal dependencies. Of course, there's been an astounding amount of work attempting to hide communication overhead alongside compute -- it was surprising to us how straightforward it was to overlap communication within the megakernel framework!To evaluate our megakernel, we integrated it into Tokasaurus, which helps schedule batches of prefill and decode, alongside KV pages. This also allows us to schedule megakernel instructions on the CPU while the previous batch is running on the GPUs; with 64 threads generating instructions in C++, we generally find >90% CPU idle time.For our benchmark, we sampled a set of 65,536 prompts + completion lengths from the ShareGPT dataset, and ran them through both SGLang and our Megakernel. We reproduced SGLang using their recommended benchmarking settings; nonetheless, we recognize that expert tuning is sensitive and important. We report the input, output, and total throughputs in Table 4 (a more precise restatement of the results from Figure 1).Input Throughput (Tokens/s)Output Throughput (Tokens/s)Total Throughput (Tokens/s)Even despite these promising initial results, we suspect there's still considerable room for optimization within megakernels. Our scheduling heuristics are quite simple, our instructions frequently stall on synchronizations that could likely be hidden better, and our megakernel still has register spills and other low-level problems. All of these point towards this being an exciting direction for future work!Conclusion: Megakernels are CoolIn this post, we introduced a tensor-parallel Llama-70B megakernel focused on maximizing decoding throughput. We designed a custom instruction set for this megakernel within our megakernel interpreter framework, and ablated several key scheduling decisions including pipelining across instruction boundaries, choosing processors for each instruction, and interleaving communication with compute. Finally, we integrated our megakernel into Tokasaurus, and found it outperformed SGLang by 22% on ShareGPT prompts.A direction for future work: a key challenge of writing megakernels is that there is tremendous complexity in both designing these custom instruction sets, and coordinating (and especially debugging) synchronization patterns across GPUs. A corresponding learning from this work is that, going forward, we'd like to design a more general megakernel instruction set and abstract these decisions into the host-side scheduler, in order to simplify the process of designing high-performance megakernels. We think this might make megakernels for training viable, alongside megakernels for inference.*Work by Jordan done while at Stanford.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will AI Mean Bring an End to Top Programming Language Rankings?</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/09/28/1823244/will-ai-mean-bring-an-end-to-top-programming-language-rankings?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 18:26:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[IEEE Spectrum ranks the popularity of programming languages — but is there a problem? Programmers "are turning away from many of these public expressions of interest. Rather than page through a book or search a website like Stack Exchange for answers to their questions, they'll chat with an LLM like Claude or ChatGPT in a private conversation."

And with an AI assistant like Cursor helping to write code, the need to pose questions in the first place is significantly decreased. For example, across the total set of languages evaluated in the Top Programming Languages, the number of questions we saw posted per week on Stack Exchange in 2025 was just 22% of what it was in 2024... 

However, an even more fundamental problem is looming in the wings... In the same way most developers today don't pay much attention to the instruction sets and other hardware idiosyncrasies of the CPUs that their code runs on, which language a program is vibe coded in ultimately becomes a minor detail... [T]he popularity of different computer languages could become as obscure a topic as the relative popularity of railway track gauges... But if an AI is soothing our irritations with today's languages, will any new ones ever reach the kind of critical mass needed to make an impact? Will the popularity of today's languages remain frozen in time?
 
That's ultimately the larger question. "how much abstraction and anti-foot-shooting structure will a sufficiently-advanced coding AI really need...?"

[C]ould we get our AIs to go straight from prompt to an intermediate language that could be fed into the interpreter or compiler of our choice? Do we need high-level languages at all in that future? True, this would turn programs into inscrutable black boxes, but they could still be divided into modular testable units for sanity and quality checks. And instead of trying to read or maintain source code, programmers would just tweak their prompts and generate software afresh. 

What's the role of the programmer in a future without source code? Architecture design and algorithm selection would remain vital skills... How should a piece of software be interfaced with a larger system? How should new hardware be exploited? In this scenario, computer science degrees, with their emphasis on fundamentals over the details of programming languages, rise in value over coding boot camps. 

Will there be a Top Programming Language in 2026? Right now, programming is going through the biggest transformation since compilers broke onto the scene in the early 1950s. Even if the predictions that much of AI is a bubble about to burst come true, the thing about tech bubbles is that there's always some residual technology that survives. It's likely that using LLMs to write and assist with code is something that's going to stick. So we're going to be spending the next 12 months figuring out what popularity means in this new age, and what metrics might be useful to measure. 
Having said that, IEEE Spectrum still ranks programming language popularity three ways — based on use among working programmers, demand from employers, and "trending" in the zeitgeist — using seven different metrics. 

Their results? Among programmers, "we see that once again Python has the top spot, with the biggest change in the top five being JavaScript's drop from third place last year to sixth place this year. As JavaScript is often used to create web pages, and vibe coding is often used to create websites, this drop in the apparent popularity may be due to the effects of AI... In the 'Jobs' ranking, which looks exclusively at what skills employers are looking for, we see that Python has also taken 1st place, up from second place last year, though SQL expertise remains an incredibly valuable skill to have on your resume."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Did ancient homo sapiens think like us 👀? #shorts #human #anthropology #science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GsdfZEoLmxQ</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GsdfZEoLmxQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 17:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Best of Earth Science: http://bit.ly/EarthLabOriginals

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION
An expansive look at the virtues and contradictions of the war and the birth of the United States of America, the film follows dozens of figures from a wide variety of backgrounds. Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.

The Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.

The film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

But for these women from Kharkiv, Ukraine, being in this team was never just about winning or exercise. It always meant much more.

Then Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine - and their friendship and seemingly indestructible team cohesion were put to the test. Each team member faced a difficult choice: to stay or leave; to remain in their home country or bring their family and themselves to safety. Sveta, a member of the core team, chose to flee to the Netherlands with her family, while captain Valia and coach Nadia held out in Kharkiv, a city that has been bombed repeatedly. Despite terror, heartache, and Sveta's feelings of guilt for having left Ukraine, the women try to stay connected as their lives and views drift apart. 

Director Mariia Ponomarova met the "Nice Ladies" cheerleading squad long before Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine began. She was impressed by their joy and team spirit. This documentary is a long-time observation of the group, capturing the highs and lows of their lives, and showing how friendships are tested in war.

Software development is fundamentally a practice of problem-solving, and so, as with
solving a tricky crossword, most of the work is done in your head.In the software development lifecycle, coding is the letters filled into the crossword,
only a small amount of effort compared to all the head scratching and scribbled notes.
The real work
usually happens alongside coding, as the developer learns the domain, narrows down
requirements, maps out relevant abstractions, considers side effects, tests features
incrementally, and finally squashes bugs that survived this rigorous process. It looks
something like this:But with AI-driven coding, things play out very differently.“Code first, ask questions later”AI coding agents such as Claude Code are
making it astonishingly fast to write code in isolation. But most software lives within
complex systems, and since LLMs can't yet hold the full context
of an application in memory at once, human review, testing, and integration needs will
remain. And that is a lot harder when the code has been written without the human thinking
about it. As a result, for complex software, much of the time will be spent on post hoc
understanding of what code the AI has written.This is the root of the difference between marketing copy that boasts of the paradigm
shifting speed of  with AI (often framed as
“10Xfaster”), and the marginal productivity gains
in delivering working software seen in the wild (usually
closer to 10%).An even more dispiriting upshot of this is that, as developers, we spend an ever greater
proportion of our time merely fixing up the output of these wondrous
babbling machines. While the LLMs get to
blast through all the fun, easy work at lightning speed, we are then left with all the
thankless tasks: testing to ensure existing functionality isn’t broken, clearing out
duplicated code, writing documentation, handling deployment and infrastructure, etc.
Very little time is actually dedicated to the thing that developers actually love doing: coding.Fortunately, help is at hand. While LLMs are shaking up how software development is
performed, this issue in itself is not actually new. In fact, it is merely a stark example
of an age-old problem, which I call:As engineers progress in their careers, they will eventually
step into the role of . They might be  a team,
or they could be a , driving technical delivery without the
people management. In either case, they are responsible for the team’s technical
delivery. They are also usually the most experienced developer in the team: either in their career,
in the specialised domain of the team, or in both.Software delivery is a team effort, but one in which experience can have a highly imbalancing
effect on individual contribution
velocity. As such, when the tech lead’s
primary job is to maximise delivery, they will often face an internal conflict between two
ways to deliver software: across the team, maximising learning and ownership opportunities for
junior team members, but allowing delivery to be bottlenecked by the speed of the least productive
team members. the team, by delegating only the easy or non-critical work to juniors,
and keeping the hardest work for themselves, as the person on the team most capable of
delivering at speed.Unfortunately, while we shall see that mollycoddling is extremely harmful to long-term team
health, it is also often a very effective way to accelerate delivery. The higher bandwidth of
the tech lead is often most efficiently deployed by eating up all the hardest work:As such, I have seen this pattern repeated time and again over the course of my career. And,
of course, it comes at a cost. Siloing of experience in the tech lead makes the team brittle,
it makes support harder, and it places ever greater pressure on the tech lead as a single point
of failure. What follows next is predictable: burnout, departure, and ensuing crisis as the
team struggles to survive without the one person who really knows how everything works.As is usually the case, the solution lies in a third way that avoids these two extremes
and balances delivery with team growth. We might frame it as something like:Implement team practices that allow engineers to deliver working code within a framework
that minimises rework, maximises effective collaboration, and promotes personal growth and
learning.When I was CTO of Datasine, we enshrined this attitude in a simple tech team motto:Learn. Deliver. Have fun.Good tech leads expose their engineers to work at the limit of their capabilities,
using processes and practices that minimise delivery risk while also enabling each team
member to grow their skills, knowledge, and domain expertise. This is, in fact, the essence
of good technical leadership.There are many ways to accomplish it, from strict codified frameworks such as the
Extreme Programming rules, through
to looser sets of principles which we might broadly refer to as “best practices”:So, for experienced engineers today, an urgent question is: how can we translate these practices
into a world of AI-driven coding?LLMs are lightning fast junior engineersIn 2025, many engineers are finding themselves for the first time in a position familiar
to every tech lead: overseeing a brilliant but unpredictable junior engineer. Harnessing
and controlling such talent, in a way that benefits effective team collaboration, is one
of the primary challenges of engineering leadership. But AI coding agents need different
management to junior engineers, because the nature of their productivity and growth is
fundamentally different.As software engineers gain experience, we tend to improve our productivity in multiple
ways at the same time: writing more robust code, using better abstractions, spending less
time writing and fixing bugs, understanding more complex architectures, covering edge
cases more effectively, spotting repeated patterns earlier, etc. Engineering is a rich
and complex discipline with many avenues for specialisation, but for simplicity we might
group these dimensions into two broad themes:: ability to deliver more complex, more performant, more maintainable code: ability to develop working, bug-free code in a shorter space of timeOver time, good engineers will improve in both axes.Early LLMs were fast to write code, but time spent fixing bugs and removing hallucinations
meant they were slow to complete bug-free code. Over time, smarter LLMs and better use of
context engineering and tools have meant that modern AI coding agents are much better at
“one shot” writing of code. The current generation of commercially available agents can be
incredibly fast at producing working code for problems that would challenge some mid-level
engineers, though they cannot yet match the expertise of senior engineers:So we can think of the current generation of AI coding agents as junior engineers, albeit
with two fundamental differences:LLMs deliver code much, much faster than junior engineers, constrained neither by thinking
nor writing time;LLMs have no true capacity to learn, and instead only improve through more effective
context engineering or
the arrival of new foundation models.As with junior engineering talent, there are broadly two ways that you can deploy them, depending on
whether your focus is long-term or short-term:: employing best practices, foregrounding human
understanding of the code, moving slowly to make development sustainable.: throwing caution to the wind and implementing at speed, sacrificing
understanding for delivery velocity, hitting an eventual wall of unsalvageable, messy code.As might be expected, the long-term trajectories of choosing between these two approaches
follow much the same pattern as choosing between parallel delegation and mollycoddling of a
junior team:This is why the vibe coding approach
is great for tiny projects or throwaway prototypes: applications of sufficient simplicity
can be delivered without the need for any human thinking at all. By limiting the complexity
of our projects and leaning into the capabilities of the tools, we can deliver end-to-end
working software in no time at all.But you  hit a wall of complexity that AI is incapable of scaling alone.Building prototypes is now easier than ever. But if we want to effectively use LLMs to
accelerate delivery of real, complex, secure, working software, and to realise more than
marginal efficiency gains, we need to write a new playbook of engineering practices tailored
to maximise collaboration between engineering teams that include both humans and LLMs.How to avoid the AI coding trapAI coding agents are dazzlingly productive, but lack in-depth knowledge of your business,
codebase, or roadmap. Left unchecked, they will happily churn
out thousands of lines of code with no heed paid to design, consistency, or maintainability.
The job of the engineer, then, is to act as a tech lead to these hotshots: to provide the structure,
standards, and processes that convert raw speed into sustainable delivery.We need a new playbook for how to deliver working software efficiently, and we can look to the
past to learn how to do that. By treating LLMs as lightning-fast junior engineers, we
can lean on best practices from the software development lifecycle to build systems that scale.Just as tech leads don't just write code but set practices for the team, engineers
now need to set practices for AI agents. That means bringing AI into every stage of
the lifecycle:: exploring, analysing, and refining feature specifications to cover edge cases and narrow focus.: generating and reviewing documentation up front to provide reusable guardrails and lasting evidence.: scaffolding modular architectures to control context scope and maximise comprehension.: generating extensive test cases prior to implementation to guide implementation and prevent regression.: applying house styles and best practice when generating code, through context engineering.Monitoring & Introspection: analysing logs and extracting insights faster than any human ever could.By understanding that delivering software is so much more than just writing code, we can
avoid the AI coding trap and instead hugely amplify our ability to deliver working, scalable software.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Alex Gómez-Marín - Consciousness and Ultimate Reality</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uitdvf8QwCg</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uitdvf8QwCg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 15:01:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Closer To Truth is now on Bluesky!

What is the relationship between consciousness and the nature of ultimate reality? Some say there is no relationship; consciousness is a late, contingent product of biological evolution. Others say consciousness is irreducible and fundamental, whether part of ultimate reality or all of it. Does it make sense to explore consciousness and cosmos together?

Each of us took
many pictures, and when we came back we put them all in a shared folder.
We both have Android phones, and the naming scheme used for our pictures
was the same:  followed maybe by some other numbers
and then a . Here  stands for the year,  for month and
so on, so that sorting the pictures in alphabetical order is the same as
sorting them by date.Or so I thought. Strangely, when I looked at the files from my dad’s
Windows PC, they were not sorted correctly: all the pictures took
with my phone came first, followed by all the pictures took by him.
I thought this was surely some weird Microsoft bug - after using
Windows 11 at work for a while, I would not be surprised if you
told me their file explorer can’t figure out how to sort strings.But then I looked at the same files in a shared Google Drive folder,
and again they were in the wrong order:As you can see, the picture taken at 5:54 (with my dad’s phone) comes
before the one taken at 9:20 (also with my dad’s phone), but after the
one taken at 12:11 (with my phone).Weird. Well, maybe Microsoft  Google got this wrong. But
that seems unlikely.Indeed, KDE’s Dolphin file manager does the same thing:I’ll spare you the screenshots, but Gnome and both the file managers
that I have on my phone also get the alphabetical order wrong.At this point I thought that maybe one of the two phones is using some
weird alternative unicode character instead of the underscore . Really,
I could not see any other explanation. But nope, this is not it, because
the good old  sorts my files correctly:$ ls -l

(and so on)
This was consistent among the couple of Linux distros I use, as well
as my OpenBSD server. On the one hand this is good: not  single
piece of software fucks up something as basic as string sorting. On the
other hand, this makes it harder to debug what the fuck is going on with
all the other file managers.It took me more than a month to figure this one out. Tell me, which
file do you think comes first in alphabetical order,  or
?Of course, the user who named those files probably wants  to
come before . But  is smaller than , so 
should be first in alphabetical order. Everyone understands that, and
soon people learn to put enough leading zeros if they want their files
to stay sorted the way they like.Well, apparently all these operating systems have decided that no,
users are too dumb and they cannot possibly understand what alphabetical
order means.  So when you ask them to sort your files alphabetically,
they don’t. Instead, they decide that if some piece of the file name is
a number, the real numerical value must be used.I don’t know when this became the norm, to be honest I have not used a
normal graphical file manager in a long time.I know you asked for the files to be sorted in alphabetical order,
but you don’t want  to come before , do
you? No, I know you don’t. I am not even going to ask you, your
mushy human brain is too small to comprehend the intricacies of
such a question. I’ll spare you the thinking.So it turns out that my dad’s phone wrote the milliseconds in the file
name right after the seconds, while mine added an extra underscore to
separate them from the seconds.  Which in my mind it should not have
mattered, because alphabetically they should still have been sorted
correctly to the second. But with this “modern” interpretation of the
alphabetical order, the files without the extra separator in the name had
a much higher number, so they come last.Now that I know what the issue is, I can solve it by renaming the files
with a consistent scheme. I have also found a setting to fix Dolphin’s
behavior, but it was very much buried into its many configuration
options. And I would rather not have to change this setting in every
application I use, assuming they even allow it.I miss the time when computers did what you told them to, instead of
trying to read your mind.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build Your Own Commodore 64 Cartridge</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/commodore-64-cartridge</link><author>Stephen Cass</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTY1ODk0NC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5Nzk0NzExN30.IdPaAZhq9_vVpSiUdyI-rJ2P8N5EUd-65mCEkZjK4iI/image.png?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 13:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You can do it with free software and just a few dollars in parts]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Privacy Badger is a free browser extension made by EFF to stop spying</title><link>https://privacybadger.org/</link><author>doener</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 12:59:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Privacy Badger is a browser extension that stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web.  If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser from loading any more content in your browser.  To the advertiser, it’s like you suddenly disappeared.Privacy Badger was born out of our desire to be able to recommend a single extension that would:Automatically analyze and block any tracker or ad that violated the principle of user consentFunction well without any settings, knowledge, or configuration by the userUse algorithmic methods to decide what is and isn’t trackingBe produced by an organization that is unambiguously working for its users rather than for profitAs a result, Privacy Badger differs from traditional ad-blocking extensions in two key ways. First, while most other blocking extensions prioritize blocking ads, Privacy Badger doesn’t block ads unless they happen to be tracking you; in fact, one of our goals is to incentivize advertisers to adopt better privacy practices.Second, most other blockers rely on a human-curated list of domains or URLs to block. Privacy Badger is an algorithmic tracker blocker – we define what “tracking” looks like, and then Privacy Badger blocks or restricts domains that it observes tracking in the wild. What is and isn’t considered a tracker is entirely based on how a specific domain acts, not on human judgment.Privacy Badger sends the Global Privacy Control signal to opt you out of data sharing and selling, and the Do Not Track signal to tell companies not to track you. If trackers ignore these signals, Privacy Badger will learn to block them.Beyond this, Privacy Badger comes with other advantages like cookie blocking, click-to-activate placeholders for potentially useful tracker widgets (video players, comments widgets, etc.), and outgoing link click tracking removal on Facebook and Google.Privacy Badger was created by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit organization that protects your privacy and free expression online. We make free tools like Privacy Badger, publish educational guides, testify before lawmakers about technology, and fight for the public interest in court—all thanks to support from EFF’s members. If you want a better internet and a strong democracy, join the fight against creepy online surveillance.When you view a webpage, that page will often be made up of content from many different sources. For example, a news webpage might load the actual article from the news company, ads from an ad company, and the comments section from a different company that’s been contracted out to provide that service.Privacy Badger keeps track of all of this. If the same source seems to be tracking across different websites, then Privacy Badger springs into action, telling the browser not to load any more content from that source. And when your browser stops loading content from a source, that source can no longer track you. Voila!At a more technical level, Privacy Badger keeps track of the “third party” domains that embed images, scripts and advertising in the pages you visit. Privacy Badger looks for tracking techniques like uniquely identifying cookies, local storage “supercookies,” and canvas fingerprinting. If it observes the same third-party host tracking on three separate sites, Privacy Badger will automatically disallow content from that third-party tracker.By default, Privacy Badger receives periodic learning updates from Badger Sett, our Badger training project. This “remote learning” automatically discovers trackers present on thousands of the most popular sites on the Web.When you visit a webpage parts of the page may come from domains and servers other than the one you asked to visit. This is an essential feature of hypertext. On the modern Web, embedded images and code often use cookies and other methods to track your browsing habits — often to display advertisements. The domains that do this are called “third party trackers”, and you can read more about how they work here.Red means that content from this third party domain has been completely disallowed.Yellow means that the third party domain appears to be trying to track you, but it is on Privacy Badger’s cookie-blocking “yellowlist” of third party domains that, when analyzed, seemed to be necessary for Web functionality. In that case, Privacy Badger will load content from the domain but will try to screen out third party cookies and referrers from it.Green means “no action”; Privacy Badger will leave the domain alone.Actually, nothing in the Privacy Badger code is specifically written to block ads. Rather, it focuses on disallowing any visible or invisible “third party” scripts or images that appear to be tracking you even though you specifically denied consent by sending Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control signals. It just so happens that most (but not all) of these third party trackers are advertisements. When you see an ad, the ad sees you, and can track you. Privacy Badger is here to stop that.Because Privacy Badger is primarily a privacy tool, not an ad blocker. Our aim is not to block ads, but to prevent non-consensual invasions of people’s privacy because we believe they are inherently objectionable. We also want to create incentives for advertising companies to do the right thing. Of course, if you really dislike ads, you can also install a traditional ad blocker.Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a new specification that allows users to tell companies they’d like to opt out of having their data shared or sold. By default, Privacy Badger sends the GPC signal to every company you interact with alongside the Do Not Track (DNT) signal.What’s the difference? Do Not Track is meant to tell companies that you don’t want to be tracked in any way (learn more about what we mean by “tracking” here). Privacy Badger gives third-party companies a chance to comply with DNT by adopting our DNT policy, and blocks those that look like they’re tracking you anyway.When DNT was developed, many websites simply ignored users’ requests not to be tracked. That’s why Privacy Badger has to act as an enforcer: trackers that don’t want to comply with your wishes get blocked. Today, users in many jurisdictions have the legal right to opt out of some kinds of tracking. That’s where GPC comes in.GPC is meant to be a legally-binding request to all companies in places with applicable privacy laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act gives California residents the right to opt out of having their data sold. By sending the GPC signal, Privacy Badger is telling companies that you would like to exercise your rights.The CCPA and other laws are not perfect, which is why Privacy Badger uses both approaches. It asks websites to respect your privacy, and it blocks known trackers from loading at all.At present, Privacy Badger primarily protects you against tracking by third party sites. As far as privacy protections for “first party” sites (sites that you visit directly), Privacy Badger removes outgoing link click tracking on Facebook and Google. We plan on adding more first party privacy protections in the future.We are doing things in this order because the most scandalous, intrusive and objectionable form of online tracking is that conducted by companies you’ve often never heard of and have no relationship with. First and foremost, Privacy Badger is there to enforce Do Not Track against these domains by providing the technical means to restrict access to their tracking scripts and images. The right policy for whether nytimes.com, facebook.com or google.com can track you  – and the technical task of preventing it – is more complicated because often tracking is interwoven with the features the site offers.Unlike other blocking tools, we have not made decisions about which sites to block, but rather about which behavior is objectionable. Domains will only be blocked if Privacy Badger observes the domain collecting unique identifiers after it was sent Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control signals.Privacy Badger  contain a “yellowlist” of some sites that are known to provide essential third party resources; those sites show up as yellow and have their cookies blocked rather than being blocked entirely. This is a compromise with practicality, and in the long term we hope to phase out the yellowlist as these third parties begin to explicitly commit to respecting Do Not Track. The criteria for including a domain on the yellowlist can be found here.The initial list of domains that should be cookie blocked rather than blocked entirely was derived from a research project on classifying third party domains as trackers and non-trackers. We will make occasional adjustments to it as necessary. If you find domains that are under- or over-blocked, please file a bug on GitHub.Browser fingerprinting is an extremely subtle and problematic method of tracking, which we documented with the Cover Your Tracks project. Privacy Badger can detect canvas-based fingerprinting, and will block third party domains that use it. Detection of other forms of fingerprinting and protections against first-party fingerprinting are ongoing projects. Of course, once a domain is blocked by Privacy Badger, it will no longer be able to fingerprint you.No. Privacy Badger analyzes the cookies from each site; unique cookies that contain tracking IDs are disallowed, while “low entropy” cookies that perform other functions are allowed. For instance a cookie like LANG=fr that encodes the user’s language preference, or a cookie that preserves a very small amount of information about ads the user has been shown, would be allowed provided that individual or small groups of users’ reading habits could not be collected with them.We are working towards Safari on macOS support. Safari on iOS seems to lack certain extension capabilities required by Privacy Badger to function properly.Chrome on Android does not support extensions. To use Privacy Badger on Android, install Firefox for Android.If you use Google Chrome, you have to install extensions from Chrome Web Store. To install Privacy Badger in Chrome, visit Privacy Badger’s Chrome Web Store listing and click the “Add to Chrome” button there.Otherwise, you can use the following links to get the latest version of Privacy Badger directly from eff.org:One way is to stop tracking users who have turned on Global Privacy Control or Do Not Track signals (i.e., stop collecting cookies, supercookies or fingerprints from them). Privacy Badger will stop learning to block that domain. The next version of Privacy Badger to ship with an updated pre-trained list will no longer include that domain in the list. Most Privacy Badger users will then update to that list.You can also unblock yourself by promising to meaningfully respect the Do Not Track signal. To do so, post a  copy of EFF’s Do Not Track policy to the URL https://example.com/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt, where “example.com” is replaced by your domain. Posting EFF’s DNT policy on a domain is a promise of compliance with EFF’s DNT Policy by that domain.If your domain is compliant with EFF’s DNT policy and declares this compliance, most Privacy Badgers will see this declaration the next time they encounter your domain. Also, the next version of Privacy Badger to ship with an updated pre-trained list will probably include your declaration of compliance in the list.Note that the domain must support HTTPS, to protect against tampering by network attackers. The path contains “.well-known” per RFC 5785. Also note that you must post a copy of the policy at each compliant subdomain you control. For example, if you wish to declare compliance by both sub1.example.com and sub2.example.com, you must post EFF’s DNT policy on each domain.Thanks for asking! Individual donations make up about half of EFF’s support, which gives us the freedom to work on user-focused projects. If you want to support the development of Privacy Badger and other projects like it, you can throw us a few dollars here. Thank you.Social media widgets (such as the Facebook Like button) often track your reading habits. Even if you don’t click them, the social media companies often see exactly which pages you’re seeing the widget on. When blocking social buttons and other potentially useful (video, audio, comments) widgets, Privacy Badger can replace them with click-to-activate placeholders. You will not be tracked by these replacements unless you explicitly choose to click them.Privacy Badger should be compatible with other extensions.While there is likely to be overlap between the various manually-edited advertising/tracker lists and Privacy Badger, unlike adblockers, Privacy Badger automatically learns to block trackers based on their behavior. This means that Privacy Badger may learn to block trackers your adblocker doesn’t know about.It’s fine to use Firefox’s built-in content blocking (Enhanced Tracking Protection or ETP) and Privacy Badger together. While there is overlap between Firefox’s tracker lists and Privacy Badger, Privacy Badger automatically learns to block trackers based on their behavior. This means that Privacy Badger’s automatically-generated and regularly updated blocklist contains trackers not found in Firefox’s human-generated lists. Additionally, Firefox does not fully block “tracking content” in regular (non-“private”) windows by default.EFF uses Fastly to host EFF’s Web resources: Fastly is EFF’s CDN. Privacy Badger pings the CDN for the following resources to ensure that the information in them is fresh even if there hasn’t been a new Privacy Badger release in a while:EFF does not set cookies or retain IP addresses for these queries.When you install Privacy Badger, your browser warns that Privacy Badger can “access your data for all websites” (in Firefox), or “read and change all your data on the websites you visit” (in Chrome). You are right to be alarmed. You should only install extensions made by organizations you trust.Privacy Badger requires these permissions to do its job of automatically detecting and blocking trackers on all websites you visit. We are not ironically (or unironically) spying on you. For more information, see our Privacy Badger extension permissions explainer.Note that the extension permissions warnings only cover what the extension has access to, not what the extension actually does with what it has access to (such as whether the extension secretly uploads your browsing data to its servers). Privacy Badger will never share data about your browsing unless you choose to share it (by filing a broken site report). For more information, see EFF’s Privacy Policy for Software.Is YouTube not working? Try disabling Privacy Badger on YouTube. If that resolves the issue, see if re-enabling Privacy Badger breaks YouTube again. If YouTube goes back to not working, please tell us so we can look into what’s going on.Are you surprised that ads aren’t being blocked on YouTube? Privacy Badger is primarily a privacy tool, not an ad blocker. When you visit YouTube directly, Privacy Badger does not block ads on YouTube because YouTube does not use “third party” trackers. If you really dislike ads, you can also install a traditional ad blocker.If a website isn’t working like it should, you can disable Privacy Badger just for that site, leaving Privacy Badger enabled and protecting you everywhere else. To do so, navigate to the site with the problem, click on Privacy Badger’s icon in your browser toolbar, and click the “” button in Privacy Badger’s popup. You can also let us know about broken sites using the “” button.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Swapple, a little daily puzzle on linear reversible circuit synthesis</title><link>https://swapple.fuglede.dk/</link><author>fuglede_</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 12:42:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Curated gamedev specific search engine</title><link>https://gamedevtorch.com/</link><author>Voycawojka</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 10:36:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[GameDev Torch is a small gamedev specific search engine.Search gamedev related articles, game engines, frameworks, blog posts and more from a  set of websites.

Databases use data structures such as B-Trees, Hash Maps, or Bitmap indexes to create shortcuts that allows them to quickly locate rows without scanning the entire table.But what happens when your database is distributed across dozens or hundreds of machines?Where should the index live?Should it be local to each node or global across the cluster?How do we keep it consistent when data is replicated?What happens when queries span multiple machines?In this article, we will explore these challenges and learn how indexing works in distributed databases.Modern applications generate massive volumes of data, far beyond what a single machine can store or process efficiently. To scale horizontally, databases distribute data across multiple nodes in a cluster.Two core techniques make this distribution possible:The dataset is split into slices, and each shard is stored on a different node. For example, one shard might store users with names starting from A–M, while another stores N–Z. Queries are then routed to the relevant shard based on the partitioning strategy. Every piece of data is stored on multiple nodes to ensure fault tolerance and high availability. If one node fails, another replica can take over seamlessly.While sharding and replication provide scalability and reliability, they create new challenges for indexing:Where should indexes live?Should each shard maintain its own local index, or should the system maintain a single global index that spans all shards?How do we keep indexes consistent?When data is updated across multiple replicas, how do we ensure that indexes also reflect those changes correctly?How do we handle queries that touch multiple shards?Range queries or aggregations may need to scan data spread across several nodes. Without careful indexing strategies, these queries can become bottlenecks.These questions form the foundation of indexing in distributed databases and heavily influence the design choices made by systems like , , , and .Lets now explore two main strategies for distributed indexing:  and Local indexing is the simplest and most common strategy in distributed databases. In this approach, each shard maintains its own index for the subset of data it stores.When a query arrives, the database does not know in advance which shard contains the target data. As a result, the query must be  in a process known as :The query is sent to every shard in the cluster.Each shard uses its local index to search its own slice of data efficiently.Partial results are collected from all shards.The coordinator merges these results and returns the final answer to the client.The key point to note is that while the query still fans out to multiple shards, each shard avoids scanning its entire dataset by leveraging its local index. Each node is responsible only for its own data and index. There is no global coordination overhead. Inserts and updates affect only the shard that owns the data. The index update happens locally, making it efficient for write-heavy workloads. As data volume grows, you simply add more shards, each with its own index. To fetch a single record, the system often queries all shards. Even if each shard responds quickly, the overall latency is higher due to network communication and result merging. Scatter-gather queries can overwhelm the system as the number of nodes increases.Local indexing optimizes lookups within a shard but does little to optimize queries across shards. It works well for workloads with  or  (like analytics scans), but it struggles with highly selective queries where only one record is needed.Global indexing addresses the  directly. Instead of letting each shard operate independently, the system maintains a  that maps keys (such as user IDs or emails) to the shards where the corresponding data resides.This global view allows the system to route queries to the  that contains the data, eliminating the need for scatter-gather queries.Suppose we want to look up:SELECT * FROM Users WHERE userId = 102;With a global index, the process works like this:The query first checks the .The global index responds: “That userId is stored on .”The system forwards the query directly to Shard 3.Shard 3 (optionally using its own ) fetches the data and returns the result.This approach avoids broadcasting queries to all shards and makes targeted lookups extremely efficient. Point lookups and range queries touch only the relevant shard, reducing latency and resource usage. Queries no longer need to fan out across the cluster. From an client’s perspective, queries behave as though the entire dataset is indexed as one. The global index is itself a distributed system that must be partitioned, replicated, and synchronized. This adds operational overhead and new failure points. Each write requires at least two updates: one to the shard storing the data and another to the global index. This increases latency and can create . To keep the global index up to date, the system must choose between strong consistency (slower writes but accurate reads) and eventual consistency (faster writes but temporarily stale reads).Global indexing optimizes search across nodes but complicates write operations. It is often used in systems where reads are frequent and selective (e.g., user lookups by ID or email).One of the hardest problems in distributed indexing is keeping the index in sync with the underlying data.This problem becomes especially tricky with .For example, imagine inserting a new user into . The write succeeds on the shard, but the update to the global index fails or is delayed. For a brief period, queries that rely on the global index will not be able to locate that user, even though the data is already stored.To handle this, distributed databases typically adopt one of two consistency models: Systems like  use protocols such as  or  to ensure that both the data write and the index write happen atomically. This guarantees correctness but increases write latency. Systems like  prioritize availability and performance. They update indexes asynchronously, meaning writes are acknowledged immediately, but indexes may lag behind. For many workloads, such as analytics or logging, this trade-off is acceptable.In practice, databases often provide both options, leaving it up to developers to choose between guaranteed correctness with slower writes or faster writes with the possibility of temporary staleness, depending on the workload.Indexes in distributed databases are themselves large-scale data structures that must be carefully managed across many nodes. Just like primary data, they need to be partitioned, replicated, and kept consistent.The way partitioning and replication apply depends on the type of index: Partitioning and replication happen  as part of the shard. Each shard naturally maintains its own local index, and when the shard is replicated, the index is replicated too. No additional design is required. Partitioning and replication must be explicitly designed and managed. Because a global index spans the entire dataset across all shards, it needs its own partitioning strategy and replication mechanism. This makes it significantly more complex to maintain.Let’s look at how partitioning and replication work for  in more detail.Global indexes are often sharded in the same way as the data they reference. Instead of storing one massive index on a single machine, the index is divided into pieces and spread across the cluster.A  (commonly hash-based or range-based) decides which node stores which portion of the index.For example, if we build an index on , the system might take the hash of the email value to determine which shard should hold that entry.This prevents any single node from becoming a bottleneck for indexing or querying.Scales horizontally as data volume grows.Avoids a single point of failure.Each node handles only a fraction of the index, which reduces memory and CPU pressure.However, partitioned indexes also mean that answering a query may involve multiple shards, especially if the query spans a range of values.Global Indexes can also be replicated across multiple nodes, much like how data replication works. Instead of a single copy of an index partition, the system maintains multiple replicas.A query can be served by the , improving read latency.If one node fails, another replica can immediately take over, ensuring high availability.Improved performance through load balancing (read from the nearest replica).Improved fault tolerance, since replicas provide redundancy.All replicas must stay consistent when data is updated.Synchronization protocols introduce additional overhead.In practice, most distributed databases use a combination of partitioning and replication for global indexes:Indexes are  to achieve scalability and distribute workload evenly.Each partition is  to improve fault tolerance and query performance.This hybrid strategy ensures that distributed indexes can scale with data growth while remaining resilient to failures and responsive to queries.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The hard disk driver is a user process, so is the file system running on top of it. The namespace manager is a user process. The whole thing (in theory, see below) supports network transparency from the ground up, you can use resources of other nodes in the network just as easily as you can use local resources, just prefix them with the node ID. In the late 80’s, early 90’s I had a lot of time on my hands. While living in the Netherlands I’d run into the QNX operating system that was sold locally through a distributor. The distributors brother had need of a 386 version of that OS but Quantum Software, the producers of QNX didn’t want to release a 386 version. So I decided to write my own. Luck had it that I ended up in Poland and that the lack of work there meant I could spend a lot of time on this (life was super cheap there back then compared to my savings). In the space of about a year I wrote a proof-of-concept kernel using DJGPP and a very kludgy development system that required me resetting the system after every failure. And there were lots of failures. Thousands of them, until, finally, one day I had a very rudimentary kernel and an ‘idle’ appliation running on top of it.The next couple of years, until February 1994 (right after my first child was born and I decided I should probably get serious about earning money) I steadily improved on the original until it had a full complement of tools, was self hosting and came with a window manager and some graphics demos.When Linux was still very young, in 1992, there was a now infamous dispute between Andrew Tanenbaum, of MINIX fame and Linux Torvalds. The stakes were high: Tanenbaum thought Linus was wasting his time and talent building yet another macro kernel, he argued that micro kernels - even with a speed disadvantage - still have an edge in reliability and in speed of development. I agreed with Tanenbaum, but did not agree that MINIX was the way to go, I’d already seen QNX, and worked on my own variation on that theme and thought it was lightyears ahead of MINIX.For the longest time this project sat on my hard drive in a state in which it could not run. The hardware that it had originally been developed on had died and I had never seen fit to spend more time on it to keep it bootable. Until the start of the fall of 2025, a good 30 years later, when I talked about it with my colleague I had not thought about putting any effort into a revival. In the meantime, a lot has happened. 32 bit systems are now already past, we’re on 64 bits now and 32 bit systems are usually doing only embedded stuff. We also have virtual machines, a luxury that my 30 year prior self would have happily traded a limb for, this makes development of such low level code a lot simpler than having to dive under the table every three minutes to hit the reset button. At some point this became such a routine that I hooked up a sustain pedal footswitch so I didn’t have to dive under the desk all the time.So with modern tooling and the arena no longer vying for ‘the next best desktop solution’ I figured I should try to see if there is any life in it. Micro Kernels are fun to hack on: everything except for the core message passing task and scheduler is a user mode program and you can change it as easily as you can change any other program. That makes them unique and I think that this kind of hacking is now, especially with the more powerful embedded platforms within reach of just about anybody. The fact that it is a real time OS makes it much easier to work on hardware that requires guaranteed response time from the OS, there are 16 different priority levels and they offer very fine grained control over which tasks can be interrupted by which others.Reviving an OS that hasn’t run in 30 yearsThis was a bit of a challenge. It took about two weeks, there were a couple of lucky breaks. The first was that I had not really done any cleaning of the repository where all this code was stored, so I had quite a few binaries that could run if I had a working OS. The second was that there was an image of a boot floppy. Between those two I managed to get the system booted under VirtualBox using a RAM disk. Some days later I had a working LBA capable hard drive, which I then populated with the contents of the ramdisk, and from there it was relatively quick work to recover the rest of the system.The part that still eludes me is the bootfs.com program, this is the filesystem aware portion of the bootloader, that is loaded by the first stage on the boot floppy. There is some magic in there that for some reason does not play nice with the recovered version of TurboC, there is a chance I’m simply doing something wrong but I have not been able to successfully recompile that program and to get it to work so for now the system still boots from that original floppy image. But that’s fine, it’s not real hardware anyway and I’m sure if you really want to you can make it work again, all the pieces are there, I’ve added a VM disk image that should allow you to work on bootfs as well using freedos and some old binaries. Bootfs.com is a 16 bit real mode tiny memory model file that shuttles back-and-forth between real and protected mode to load all of the operating system components. It could boot from the hard drive as well (there is a ‘boot’ program to help you install the bootloader on an image) and like that you could do away with the floppy drive.Well, it looks like any old boring text mode operating system. There is the usual complement of utilities, a C compiler (and a C++ compiler), both are ancient but they work. There is the source tree in /usr/kernel.src and /usr/src as well as the usual unix like locations for binaries and such. There is a shell. There is some networking support but - again - I have not been able to resurrect this, and I can’t get the emulated COM ports to work either, which would have been nice as a way to move data in and out (for instance, using SLIP).Install QEMU. Download the distro (see below). Unzip the distro file, and cd to unite/os, after that run ./unite.sh and you should see a virtual machine boot up in text mode. After it has booted and you’ve clicked in the VM windows to give it keyboard focus hit alt-f2 to move to another console (one where you can type commands) and type ‘cd 3:/’ to move to the hard drive. If you’re used to some variety of Unix you will feel mostly at home but note that ‘cli’ (command line interpreter) is not a regular shell. Interesting bits to look at are in 1:/boot/config.0 and of course the directory tree of drive 3:/ (the simulated hard disk). The file system is a very much stripped down version of the MINIX file system as it was at the time, it was meant to be replaced but I never got around to it. If you type ‘tsk’ you can see which tasks are currently running and ‘sac’ gives you a rudimentary system activity monitor. If you’ve used QNX at all in the past you will feel right at home.Unite does not have the concept of a user, it is very much a single user OS but that single user can have multiple sessions. There is also a graphics mode, you can activate it by changing the ‘mode’ line in 1:/config/config.0 to ‘mode 16’ but I’d advise against that until you have the COM ports working and are able to type commands through there so you can see what you’re doing. If you are  adventurous: make a backup of the fda.img file; change that mode line and reboot. You’ll end up in a completely blind graphics mode. You should then type the following (all blind so you won’t know if you did it right or not until it works): ‘cd 3:/’ ; ‘cd bin/gp’ ; ‘ontty /dev/console.4 gp’ ; ‘ontty /dev/console.4 qwm’ ; ‘ontty /dev/console.4 qwmdesk’ (now the screen should change) ; ‘ontty /dev/console.4 qwmcalc’ (now you should see a small calculator, it would work if you had mouse/keyboard support but you don’t) ; ‘ontty /dev/console.4 qwmline’ (which should show a bouncing line demo).Now you have a problem: if you reboot the system it will go right back to that graphics mode. So now you want to restore that fda.img backup you made above.The operating system is distributed as a torrent:magnet:?xt=urn:btih:bb01f5651944948b1b705ae4efa5ab5578bdee00&dn=unite.zipThe torrent contains a single zip file that you unpack, then you follow the instructions above.I have only tested this under Linux using VirtualBox and Qemu, I have not ran it under a Windows VM or on real hardware and you may run into issues if you do.there is no networking, this is probably the first thing that really needs doingthe COM ports don’t work yet (this seems to be an emulation issue, I have yet to see a single byte in or out)the mouse driver (mp) does not work (it relies on a mouse plugged into a COM port, see above)the version of vi that is in /bin seems to add random cruft to files, I have not been able to figure out yet what the reason for that is.there is an alternative editor ‘e’ that does work, and that I wrote back in the stone agethis is not/was not an effort at making something that is ‘secure’, if you plan on using this be very much aware of that and that you are most likely going to open yourself up to being compromised within seconds if you hook this up to the big bad internet.

"In the last few weeks, Ruby Central has suddenly asserted that they alone own Bundler," he wrote. "That simply isn't true. In order to defend the reputation of the team of maintainers who have given so much time and energy to the project, I have registered my existing trademark on the Bundler project." 

He adds that trademarks do not affect copyright, which stays with the original contributors unchanged. "Trademarks only impact one thing: Who is allowed say that what they make is named 'Bundler,'" he wrote. "Ruby Central is welcome to the code, just like everyone else. They are not welcome to the project name that the Bundler maintainers have painstakingly created over the last 15 years." 

He is, however, not seeking the trademark for himself, noting that the "idea of Bundler belongs to the Ruby community." "Once there is a Ruby organization that is accountable to the maintainers, and accountable to the community, with openly and democratically elected board members, I commit to transfer my trademark to that organization," he said. "I will not license the trademark, and will instead transfer ownership entirely. Bundler should belong to the community, and I want to make sure that is true for as long as Bundler exists."
 

The blog It's FOSS also has an update on Spinel, the new worker-owned collective founded by Arko, Samuel Giddins [who Giddins led RubyGems security efforts], and Kasper Timm Hansen (who served served on the Rails core team from 2016 to 2022 and was one of its top contributors):

These guys aren't newcomers but some of the architects behind Ruby's foundational infrastructure. Their flagship offering is rv ["the Ruby swiss army knife"], a tool that aims to replace the fragmented Ruby tooling ecosystem. It promises to [in the future] handle everything from rvm, rbenv, chruby, bundler, rubygems, and others — all at once while redefining how Ruby development tools should work... Spinel operates on retainer agreements with companies needing Ruby expertise instead of depending on sponsors who can withdraw support or demand control. This model maintains independence while ensuring sustainability for the maintainers. 

The Register had reported Thursday:

 Spinel's 'rv' project aims to supplant elements of RubyGems and Bundler with a more modular, version-aware manager. Some in the Ruby community have already accused core Rails figures of positioning Spinel as a threat. For example, Rafael FranÃa of Shopify commented that admins of the new project should not be trusted to avoid "sabotaging rubygems or bundler."

The former colony that is still treated a bit like a colony is something that inspires a lot of emotions. Greenland has been subjected to a lot of unethical experiments by Denmark, from taking their kids to wild experiments in criminal justice. But there is also a genuine pride a lot of people have here for the place and you run into Danes who grew up there more often than I would have guessed. When the idea of going to Greenland was introduced to me, I was curious. Having lived in Denmark for awhile, you hear a lot about the former colony and its 55,000 residents. We were invited by a family that my wife was close with growing up and is Danish. They wanted to take their father back to see the place he had spend some time in during his 20s and had left quite an impression. A few drinks in, I said "absolutely let's do it", not realizing we had already committed to going and I had missed the text message chain. A few weeks before I went, I realized "I don't know anything about Greenland" and started to watch some YouTube videos. It was about this time when I started to get a pit in my stomach, the "oh god I think I've made a huge mistake" feeling I'm painfully familiar with after a career in tech.  Greenland appeared to have roughly 9 people living there and maybe 5 things to look at. Even professional travel personalities seemed to be scraping the bottom of the barrel. "There's the grocery store again!" they would point out as they slipped down the snowy roads. I couldn't  tell any difference between different towns in the country.It reminded me a lot of driving through Indiana. For those not in the US, Indiana is a state in the US famous for being a state one must drive through in order to get somewhere better. If you live in Michigan, a good state and want to go to Illinois, another good state, one must pass through Indiana, a blank state. Because of this little strip here, you often found yourself passing through this place. Driving through Indiana isn't bad, it's just an empty void. It's like a time machine back to the 90s when people still smoke in restaurants but also there's nothing that sticks out about it. There is nothing distinct about Indiana, it's just a place full of people who got too tired on their way to somewhere better and decided "this is good enough". The difference is that Greenland is very hard to get to, as I was about to learn. Finally the day arrived. Me, my wife, daughter, 4 other children and 6 other adults all came to the Copenhagen Airport and held up a gate agent for what felt like an hour to slowly process all of our documents. Meanwhile, I nursed a creeping paranoia that I'd be treated as some sort of American spy, given my government's recent hobby of threatening to purchase entire countries like they're vintage motorcycles on Craigslist.The 5 hour flight is uneventful, the children are beautifully behaved and I begin to think "well this seems ok!" like the idiot I am. As I can look down and see the airport, the pilot comes on and informs us that there is too much fog to land safely. Surely fog cannot stop a modern aircraft full of all these dials and screens I think, foolishly. We are informed there is enough fuel to circle the airport for 5 hours to wait for the fog to lift. What followed was three hours of flying in lazy circles, like a very expensive, very slow merry-go-round. After the allotted time, we are informed that we must fly to Iceland to refuel and then we will be returning to Denmark. After a total of 15 hours in the air we will be going back to exactly where we started, to do the entire thing again. We were obviously upset at this turn of events, but I noticed the native Greenlandic folks seemed not surprised at this turn of events. As I later learned, this happens . The native Greenlanders on board seemed utterly unsurprised by this development, displaying the kind of resigned familiarity that suggested this was Tuesday for them. I began wondering if I could just pretend Iceland was Greenland—surely my family wouldn't notice the difference? But the pilot, apparently reading my mind, announced that no one would be disembarking in Iceland. It felt oddly authoritarian, like being grounded by an airline, as if they knew we'd all just wander off into Reykjavik and call it close enough.We crash out in a airport hotel 20 minutes from our apartment after 15 hours in the air and tons of CO2 emissions only to wake up the next day to start again. This time, I notice that all of the people are asking for (and receiving) free beer from the crew that they are stashing in their bags. It turns out soda and beer, really anything that needs to be imported, is pretty expensive in Greenland. The complimentary drinks are there to be kept for later. Finally we land. The first thing you notice when you land in Greenland is there are no trees or grass. There is snow and then there is exposed rock. The exterior of the airport is metal but the inside is wood, which is strange because again there are no trees. This would end up being a theme, where buildings representing Denmark were made out of lots of wood, almost to ensure that you understood they weren't from here. We ended up piling all of our stuff into a bus and heading for the hotel in Nuuk. Nuuk is the capital of Greenland and your introduction to the incredible calm of the Greenlandic people. I have never met a less stressed out group of humans in my life. Nobody is really rushing anywhere, it's all pretty quiet and calm. The air is cold and crisp with lots of kids playing outside and just generally enjoying life. The city itself sits in a landscape so dramatically inhospitable it makes the surface of Mars look cozy. Walking through the local mall, half the shops sell gear designed to help you survive what appears to be the apocalypse. Yet somehow, there's traffic. Actual traffic jams in a place where you can walk from one end to the other in twenty minutes. It's like being stuck behind a school bus in your own driveway.To put this map into some perspective, it is only six kilometers from the sorta furthest tip to the airport. But riding the bus around Nuuk was a peaceful experience that lets you see pretty much the entire city without needing to book a tour or spend a lot of money. We went to Katuaq, a cultural center with a cafe and a movie theater that was absolutely delicious food. But again even riding the bus around it is impossible to escape the feeling that this is a fundamentally hostile to human life place. The sun is bright and during the summer its pretty hot, with my skin feeling like it was starting the burn pretty much the second it was exposed to the light. It's hard to even dress for, with layers of sunscreen, bug spray and then something warm on top if you suddenly got cold. The sun, meanwhile, has apparently forgotten how to set, turning our hotel rooms into solar ovens. You wake up in a pool of your own sweat, crack a window for relief, and immediately get hit with air so cold it feels personal. It's like being trapped in a meteorological mood swing.So after a night here, we went back to the airport again and flew to our final destination, Ilulissat.The flight to our final destination revealed Greenland's true nature: endless, empty hills stretching toward infinity, punctuated by ice formations that look like nature's sculpture garden.Landing in Ilulissat felt like victory—we'd made it to the actual destination, not just another waypoint in our Arctic odyssey. Walking through the tiny airport, past Danish military recruitment posters (apparently someone, somewhere, thought this place needed defending), I felt genuinely optimistic for the first time in days.Well you can sleep easy Danish military, because Ilulissat is completely protected from invasion. The second I stepped outside I was set upon by a flood of mosquitos like I have never experienced before. I have been to the jungles of Vietnam, the swamps of Florida and the Canadian countryside. This was beyond anything I've ever experienced. There are bugs in my mouth, ears, eyes and nose almost immediately. The photo below is not me being dramatic, it is actually what is required to keep them off of me. In fact what you need to purchase in order to walk around this area at all are basically bug nets for your face. They're effectively plastic mesh bags that you put on. Our hotel, charming in that "remote Arctic outpost" way, sat adjacent to what I can only describe as a canine correctional facility. Dozens of sled dogs were chained to rocks like some sort of prehistoric parking lot, each with a tiny house they could retreat to when the existential weight of their circumstances became too much.Now, I'd always imagined sled dogs living their best life—running through snow, tongues lolling, living the Disney version of Arctic life. I'd never really considered their downtime, assuming they frolicked in meadows or something equally wholesome. The reality was more "minimum security prison with a view."The dogs are visited roughly twice a day by the person who owns and feeds them, which was quite the party for the dogs that lost their minds whenever the car pulled up. Soon the kids really looked forward to dog feeding time. The fish scrapes the dogs lived on came out of a chest freezer that was left exposed up on the rock face without electricity and you could smell it from 50 yards away when it opened. During one such performance, a fellow parent leaned over and whispered with the casual tone of someone commenting on the weather, "I think that one is dead." Before I could process this information, the frozen canine was unceremoniously launched over a small cliff like a furry discus. A second doggy popsicle followed shortly after, right in front of our assembled children, who watched with the kind of wide-eyed fascination usually reserved for magic shows.We stopped making dog feeding time a group activity after that and had to distract the kids from ravens flying away with tufts of dog fur. Whales taste like seaweed Obviously a big part of Greenland is the nature, specifically the icebergs. Icebergs are incredible and during the week we spend up there, I enjoyed watching them every morning. It's like watching a mountain slowly moving while you sit still. The visual contrast of the ice and the exposed stone is beautiful and peaceful. Finding our tour operator proved to be an exercise in small-town efficiency. The man who gave me directions was the same person who picked us up from the airport, who was also our tour guide, who probably doubled as the mayor and local meteorologist. It was like a one-man civic operation disguised as multiple businesses—the ultimate small-town gig economy.The sea around Greenland is calmer than anything I've ever been on before, perfectly calm and serene. All around us whales emerged, thrilling my daughter. However the biggest hit of the entire tour, maybe the entire trip, was a member of the crew who handed each of the kids a giant rock of glacier ice to eat. I had to pull my daughter away to observe the natural beauty as she ate glacier ice like it was ice cream. "LOOK AT MY ICE" she was yelling as they slipped and slid around the deck of this boat. So if you've ever wonder "what is a glacier", let me tell you. Greenland has a lot of ice and it pushes out from the land that is covers into the sea. When that happens, a lot of it breaks off. This sounds more exciting than it is. On TV in 4K it looks incredible, giant mountains of ice falling into the ocean. Honestly you can go read the same thing I did here.However that doesn't happen very often. So in order for us tourists to be able to see anything, we had to go to a very productive glacier. This means there are constantly small chunks breaking off and falling into the sea. Practically though, it kinda looks like you are a boat in a slushee. It's beautiful and something to see, but also depressing to see along the rock face how much more ice there used to be. Back in town, we hopped on the "bus". Now the bus here is clearly a retrofitted party van, complete with blue LED lights. The payment system is zip tied to a desk chair that is, itself, wedged in the front. However the bus works well and does get you around. The confusing part is that you will, once again, sometimes encounter a lot of traffic. People are driving pretty quickly and really seem to have somewhere to go. You also see a lot of fancy cars parked outside of houses here. Which begs a pretty basic question. If there was almost nowhere to drive to in Nuuk, where in the hell are these people driving. The distance between the end of the road and the beginning of the road is less than 6 km. Also the process to make a road here is beyond anything you've ever seen. Everything requires a giant pile of explosives. Where did these vehicles even come from? Why does one ship a BMW to a place accessible only by plane and boat? More importantly, where was everyone going with such determination? It was like watching a very expensive version of bumper cars, except everyone was committed to the illusion that they had somewhere important to be. Everyone had dings and scrapes like crashes were common. Grocery Store from the SeaAnyway, as I dodged speeding cars filled with people heading nowhere, I decided to hop off the bus and head to the grocery store. Inside was less a store and more the idea of a store. There was a lot of alcohol, chips, candy and shelf-stable foods, which all makes sense to me. What was strange was there wasn't a lot else, including meat. Locals couldn't be eating at the local restaurants, where the prices were as high as Berlin or Copenhagen for food. So what were they eating?When I asked one of my bus drivers, he told me that it was pretty unusual to buy meat. They purchased a lot of whale and seal meat. I had sorta heard this before, but when we stopped the bus he pointed out a group of men hauling guns out into a small boat to go shoot seals. The guns were held together with a surprising amount of duct tape, which is not something I associate with the wild. I had assumed, based on my casual reading of the news, that we were  done killing whales. As it turns out, I was wrong. They eat a lot of whale and it is, in fact, not hard to find. If you are curious, whale does not taste fishy. It tastes a little bit like if you cooked reindeer in a pot of seaweed. I wouldn't go out of your way for it, but it's not terrible. The argument I've always heard for why people still kill whales is because it's part of their culture and also because it's an important source of protein. When you hear the phrase "part of their culture" I always imagined like traditional boats going out with spears. What I didn't imagine was industrial fishing boats and an industrial crane that lifts the dead whale out of the water for "processing". Some of the illusion is broken when your boat tour guide points out the metal warehouse with the word "whale" on the side. "Yeah the water here was red with blood for a week" the guide said, counting the cigarettes left in a pack he had. Should you go to Greenland?It's a wild place unlike anywhere I've ever been. It is the closest I have ever felt to living a sci-fi type experience. The people of Greenland are amazing, tough, calm and kind. I have nothing but positive experiences to recount from the many people I met there, Danish and Greenlandic, who patiently sat through my millions of questions. However it is, by far, the least hospitable to human life place I've ever been to. The folks who live there have adapted to the situation in, frankly, genius ways.

What can philosophy bring to religion? Philosophy is a systematic way of thinking about ideas and concepts, often fundamental features of the world. The philosophy of religion uses philosophical methodologies to examine religion, from the existence and attributes of God to the problems of evil, diverse religions, and conflicting belief systems.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly explore current research into how large language models affect our cognition, memory, and learning with Nataliya Kosmyna, research scientist at the MIT Media Lab. Is AI good for us? 

Nataliya describes her experiment comparing students writing essays with three methods: ChatGPT, Google, or just their own brains. What happened when groups swapped? Why did the “LLM group” show the least functional connectivity in the brain, while Google users lit up their visual cortex? Why did so many students fail to recall or even quote their own work? Neil and Nataliya unpack how timing, cognitive load, and brain struggle are essential for true learning.

We explore cognitive load theory, video game design, and whether doctors relying on AI could lose diagnostic skills. How much AI support is too much? Could AI free up tasks so we can use our cognitive energy elsewhere? Or does it rob us of our brain power? We discuss the efficiency of the brain versus machine learning, the risks of AI companionship amplifying loneliness (or even AI psychosis) to how education must adapt for a generation raised with AI. What happens when children grow up never learning the skills that AI replaces? Does outsourcing brain work free us to be more creative or leave us dependent?

We discuss the guardrails and the crisis across schooling. How do we adapt the education system around these tools? What do we stand to lose? What do we stand to gain? Does this mean pivoting the focus away from grades and towards a more process and learning focus? Learn about BCI, brain-computer interfaces, and whether someday we’ll have LLMs in our heads. If we have all of the world's information uploaded, will we need higher education? We will all say “I know kung fu” like in the Matrix?

This article was contributed by Lee PhillipsTypst is a program for document
typesetting. It is especially well-suited to technical material
incorporating elements such as mathematics, tables, and floating
figures. It produces high-quality results, comparable to the gold standard,
LaTeX, with a simpler markup
system and easier customization, all while compiling documents
more quickly. Typst is free software, Apache-2.0 licensed, and is written in Rust.
Desire for a LaTeX replacement
LaTeX is a document typesetting system built on the foundation of Donald
Knuth's TeX. LaTeX has become the
standard tool for the preparation of scholarly papers and books in several
fields, such as mathematics and computer science, and widely adopted in
others, such as physics. TeX and LaTeX, which predate
Linux, are early free software success
stories. The quality of TeX's (and therefore LaTeX's) output rivals the
work of skilled hand typesetters for both text and mathematics.

Despite the acclaim earned by LaTeX, its community of users has been
griping about it for years, and wondering aloud whether one day a
replacement might arrive. There are several reasons for this
dissatisfaction: the LaTeX installation is huge, compilation of large
documents is not fast, and its error messages are riddles delivered by an
infuriating oracle. In addition, any nontrivial customization or alteration to the
program's behavior requires expertise in an arcane macro-expansion
language.

Along with the griping came resignation: after decades of talk about a
LaTeX replacement with nothing plausible on the horizon, and with the
recognition that LaTeX's collection of specialized packages would take
years to replace, it seemed impossible to dislodge the behemoth from its
exalted position.

I had been aware of this project for over a year but had not paid much
attention, assuming it to be yet another attempt to supplant LaTeX that was
doomed to fail. A rising chorus of enthusiasm among early
adopters, and the beginnings of acceptance of
Typst manuscripts by scholarly journals, made me curious enough
to take the young project for a spin.

Typst is available as Rust source and as a compiled binary. To install,
visit the releases
page and download the appropriate archive. There are options for Linux,
macOS and Windows; I used the
precompiled Linux version for my testing.

The "" command accepts several subcommands. Entering
"" lists all of the usable fonts to be found in
standard locations on the machine; nonstandard font directories can be
added manually. In my case, Typst found all of my 476 fonts instantly;
the only ones omitted were some ancient PostScript Type 1 fonts used
by LaTeX. Users who have LaTeX installed will have a large collection of
OpenType and TrueType math and text fonts on their machines; Typst can
use all of these. But Typst will work fine without them, as the program has
a small collection of fonts built in (try "" to see them).

Two other subcommands to explore are
"", which generates the output (PDF by default, with PDF/A,
SVG, and PNG available, along with HTML under development) from a source file, and
"" for interactive editing. The  subcommand keeps a Typst process running that
incrementally and automatically compiles the document to PDF in response to
changes in the source. To use "" effectively, the
screen should be divided into three windows: a small terminal window to monitor
the  output for error (or success) messages, the editing
window, and an area for any PDF reader that automatically reloads the
displayed document when it changes (many, such as my favorite, Sioyek, do this). The result is a
responsive live preview, even of large documents, due to Typst's speed and
incremental compilation. For example, Frans Skarman described
his experience writing his doctoral thesis in Typst, and noted
that he was able to enjoy nearly instant previews of content changes to
the book-length document. 
How Typst improves on LaTeX
Typst output is quite close to that of LaTeX. It uses the same line-breaking
algorithm developed by Donald Knuth and Michael Plass for TeX, so it
creates nicely balanced paragraphs of regular text. Its mathematical
typesetting algorithms are based closely on the
TeX algorithms, and indeed mathematical rendering is nearly
indistinguishable between the two systems.

Getting started with LaTeX can be confusing for newcomers, because it comes
with several alternative "engines" reflecting the long and complex history
of the project. These are the various binaries such as "",
"", "", "", "",
and more, each with somewhat different capabilities. For Typst there is
only "".

Markup in Typst is less verbose and easier to read than in LaTeX. It
dispenses with the plethora of curly brackets and backslashes littering
LaTeX documents by adopting, for prose, syntax in the style of Markdown, and, for
equations, a set of conventions designed for easy input. The
fact that curly brackets and backslashes are awkward to type on German
keyboards may have provided a little extra impetus for the developers to
create an alternative markup system that doesn't require a forest of these
symbols.

When users make syntax errors in markup or programming, inevitable
even in Typst, the system presents them with another dramatic improvement
over LaTeX (and TeX): error messages using colored glyphs that
clearly point out exactly where the problem is. I've even discovered that
Typst will save me from trying to run a syntactically correct infinite
loop.

Here is a bit of Typst markup for a shopping list, with
the resulting rendering to the right:
   = Shopping List
   
   == Vegetables
   
   + Broccoli
   + Asparagus (*fresh only*)
   + Plantains (_ripe and green_)
   
   == Booze
   
   + Rum
     - White
     - Dark
   + #underline[Good] gin  

The example gives a flavor of Typst's terse markup syntax. Headings are
indicated with leading  signs. Automatically numbered lists are
created by prepending  signs to items, and bulleted lists with
 signs; lists can be nested. Delimiters are shown for bold text
and italics. These are shortcuts, or markup syntax sugar, for Typst
functions for transforming text. Not every function has a corresponding
shortcut; in those cases one needs to call the function explicitly, as in
the final item.

Typst input is always within one of three modes. Markup (text) mode is the
default. The  sign preceding the function call in the last line
of the example
places Typst in "code mode". The "" function accepts a number of keyword arguments that affect its behavior, and one trailing argument, in square brackets, containing the text that it modifies. In the example, we've stuck with the default behavior, but if we wanted, for example, a red underline, we could use "". Following the square-bracketed text argument, Typst returns to interpreting input in text mode.
Other functions produce output directly, rather than modifying a text argument. This bit of Typst input:    #let word = "Manhattan"
    There are #str.len(word) letters in #word.
produces the output (in typeset form) "There are 9 letters in Manhattan.". The "" function is part of the
"" module, so it needs the namespace.
Let's take a look at the LaTeX equivalent for the first half of the
shopping list for comparison:
   \documentclass[12pt]{article}
   \begin{document}
   \section*{Shopping List}
   
   \subsection*{Vegetables}
   
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item Broccoli
   \item Asparagus ({\bfseries fresh only})
   \item Plantains (\emph{ripe and green})
   \end{enumerate}
   \end{document}   

The first two and the last line are boilerplate that is not required in
Typst. The difference in verbosity level and ease of reading the source is
clear.

The third Typst mode, in addition to markup and code, is math mode,
delimited by dollar signs. This is also best illustrated by an example:
   $ integral_0^1 (arcsin x)^2 (dif x)/(x^2 sqrt(1-x^2)) = π ln 2 $  

When this is compiled by Typst, it produces the result shown below:

Those who've used LaTeX will begin to see from this example how math in
Typst source is less verbose and easier to read than in LaTeX. Greek
letters and other Unicode symbols can be used directly, as in modern LaTeX
engines such as , which we looked at back in 2017, but with no
imports required.

The advent of the LuaTeX and LuaLaTeX projects provided users who wanted to
incorporate programming into their documents a more pleasant alternative to
the TeX macro language. As powerful as the embedded Lua system is, however,
it betrays its bolted-on status, requiring users to negotiate the interface
between Lua data structures and LaTeX or TeX internals. In Typst,
programming is thoroughly integrated into the system, with no seams between
the language used for calculation and the constructs that place characters
in the final PDF. Typst programs are invariably simpler than their LuaLaTeX
equivalents. All authors using Typst will make at least some simple use of
its programming language, as such basic necessities as changing fonts, or
customizations such as changing the style of section headings, are
accomplished by calling Typst functions.

The Typst language is somewhat similar to Rust, perhaps
unsurprisingly. Most Typst functions are : they have no side effects and
always produce the same result given the same arguments (aside from certain
functions that mutate their arguments, such as ). This
aspect reduces the probability of difficult-to-debug conflicts among
packages that plague LaTeX, and makes it easier to debug Typst documents.

Although Typst uses the same line-breaking algorithm as LaTeX, its internal
approach to overall page layout is distinct. Some
consequences are that Typst does a better job at handling movable elements
such as floating figures, and can, for example, easily split large tables
across page breaks, something that LaTeX struggles with even with
specialized packages.

Typst's page layout algorithm doesn't always permit the refinements that 
LaTeX is capable of.
For example, Typst is not as good
as LaTeX at avoiding widows
and orphans.
Another salient deficiency is Typst's relative lack of specialized packages,
compared with the vast ecosystem produced by LaTeX's decades of community
involvement. However, the relative ease of programming in Typst (and the
well-organized and extensively commented underlying Rust code) suggests
that this drawback may be remedied before a comparable number of decades
have elapsed. Indeed, there are already over 800 packages available. Typst still cannot do
everything that LaTeX can, but the breadth of its package collection is
encouraging.

Almost no journals that provide LaTeX templates for submissions offer a
Typst option, so physicists and mathematicians adopting Typst will need to
find a way to convert their manuscripts. This is made easier for those who
use Pandoc, as that conversion program
handles Typst.

Another drawback is the difficulty of learning Typst. The official documentation is confusingly
organized, with information scattered unpredictably among "Tutorial",
"Reference", and "Guides" sections. Concepts are not always clearly
explained, and sometimes not presented in a logical order. The manual is
not keeping up with the rapid development of the program, and contains some
out-of-date information and errors. None of this is surprising considering
how quickly the project is moving, its early stage, and its
small core team. A work-in-progress called the  has appeared, which may be a better starting point
than the official documentation.

There are other minor deficiencies compared with LaTeX, such as the
inability to include PDF documents. Typst provides no analogue to LaTeX's
 command, which lets authors mold paragraphs to, for
example, wrap around complex illustrations. The situation is likely to
change, however, as something like  is being
considered for the future.

More serious is the possibility of breaking changes as the system evolves,
always a risk of early adoption. I suspect, however, that these will require
only minor edits to documents in most cases. Progress seems to be steady,
rational, and responsive to
user requests.

I'm using Typst in real work right now to write a physics paper. I will
need to submit my manuscript using the journal's LaTeX template, but I'm
taking advantage of Typst to make the entry of the paper's many equations
simpler, and I'll transform the result to
LaTeX with Pandoc without needing any manual adjustment. The tooling is excellent, as my preferred editor, Neovim, has support
for the Tree-sitter
incremental parser
for Markdown and Typst, which provides syntax-aware highlighting
and navigation of the source files. I use Typst's fast incremental
compilation to get live feedback as I fiddle with my math markup.

I was skeptical when I downloaded Typst to try it out, but became
enthusiastic within minutes, as I saw the first (of many) of its lovely
error messages, and remained sanguine as I saw the quality of its output. I
predict that Typst will eventually take the place of LaTeX. But even if
that never comes to pass, it is a useful tool right now.

Rather than searching for the hedgehogs directly, researcher Gabriel Mahler developed an AI model that identifies brambles, which are thorny shrubs that hedgehogs use for shelter and foraging, from satellite data.These small mammals rely on this type of dense vegetation for daytime shelter, nesting sites, and protection from predators. Brambles also attract insects and provide berries, supporting the invertebrate populations that hedgehogs eat.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fierce Lioness Saves Her Cubs Lives | Big Cats 24/7</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYrAIiDQVs0</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GYrAIiDQVs0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 22:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more of this series: https://to.pbs.org/4fIVkd1 | #BigCatsPBS

Big Cats 24/7
Season Two sees the return of a familiar cast of human and big cat characters. The expert team of cinematographers — Gordon Buchanan, Anna Dimitriadis, Brad Bestelink, Sets Nthomiwa, Rea Schulte to Brinke, Greg Hartman and Tristen Woodward — live and work together from the Natural History Film Unit, Botswana’s remote film camp in the heart of big cat territory. Together, they follow the twists and turns in the lives of key, named big cats, introduced in Season One. Across five vital months, cats — and humans — battle punishing seasonal change, from flood to extreme drought. Over brutal terrain, in searing temperatures and through day and night, the team keeps its cameras rolling 24/7 to capture unparalleled, unseen animal behavior. State-of-the-art thermal cameras, and the latest in drone technology, mean the team can film the cats from the ground, the air and, uniquely, through the night, revealing yet more brand-new insights into their lives.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside Oxide (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/110</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/110/changelog--friends-110.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 21:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bryan Cantrill and Steve Tuck, the co-founders of Oxide, are on the pod live (to tape) from the stage at OxCon.

Yes, there are plenty of closed source products and businesses. But the shared infrastructure—the commons—runs on open source.We might take this for granted, but it wasn’t a foregone conclusion thirty five years ago. There were powerful forces that wanted open source to lose. Some believed in the open source model but didn’t think it could ever compete with closed source. Many categories of tools only existed as closed source. A Microsoft CEO called open source cancer—a decade before Microsoft has rebuilt its empire around it. The open source movement may not have lived up to the ideals of the “free software”, but it won in industry adoption. Nobody gets fired for choosing open source these days. For much crucial software, open source is now .I believe we are at a similar juncture with social apps as we have been with open source thirty five years ago. There’s a new movement on the block. I like to call it . There are competing visions for what “open social” should be like. I think the AT Protocol created by Bluesky is the most convincing take on it so far. It’s not perfect, and it’s a work in progress, but there’s nothing I know quite like it.(Disclosure: I used to work at Bluesky on the Bluesky client app. I wasn’t involved in the protocol design. I am a fan, and this post is my attempt to explain why.)In this post, I’ll explain the ideas of the AT Protocol, lovingly called , and how it changes the relationship between the user, the developer, and the product.I don’t expect atproto and its ecosystem (known as ) to win hearts overnight. Like open source, it might take a few decades to become ubiquitous. By explaining these ideas here, I’m hoping to slightly nudge this timeline. Despite the grip of today’s social media companies, I believe open social will eventually seem inevitable in retrospect—just like open source does now. Good things  happen; all it takes is years of sustained effort by a community of stubborn enthusiasts.What open source did for code, open social does for data.The web is a beautiful invention.You type  and you end up on Alice’s website.Or you type  and you end up on Bob’s website.In a sense, your browser is a portal to millions of different worlds, each with its own little jurisdiction. Only Alice decides what appears on Alice’s website. Only Bob decides what appears on Bob’s website. They meaningfully “own their data”.This doesn’t mean that they’re isolated. On the contrary, Alice can embed Bob’s picture with an , and Bob can link to Alice’s page with :Alice and Bob can link to each other, but they remain in charge of their sites.What do I  by saying Alice and Bob are in charge of their own sites? Even if they’re not physically hosting their content on their own computers, they could always change hosting. For example, if Alice’s hosting provider starts deleting her pages or injecting ads into them, Alice can take her content to another host, and point  at another computer. The visitors won’t need to know. Hosting providers have no real leverage over Alice and Bob. If the hosting provider “turns evil” and starts messing with your site, you can just walk away and host it elsewhere (as long as you have a backup). You’re not going to lose your traffic. All existing links will seamlessly resolve to the new destination.If Alice changes her hosting, Bob won’t need to update any links to Alice’s website. Alice’s site will keep working as if nothing had happened. At worst, a DNS change might make it inaccessible for a few hours, but then the web will be repaired:Imagine how different the incentives would be if links  tied to physical hosts!If changing a hosting provider caused Alice to lose her traffic, she would think many times before changing providers. Perhaps she’d stick with her existing provider even if it was messing with her site, as losing her connections is even worse. Luckily, web’s decentralized design avoids this. Because it’s easy to walk away, hosting providers are forced to compete, and hosting is now a commodity.I think the web is a beautiful idea. It links decentralized islands controlled by different people and companies into one interconnected surface that anyone can index and navigate. Links describe a relationship between logical documents rather than between physical servers. As a result, you’re not a hostage to your hosting.As a wise person said, in theory, there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is. So what’s been happening with the web?In the early 90’s, the main way to publish something on the web was to have your own website. Today, most people publish content by using a social media app.Alice and Bob are still publishing things. But instead of publishing at domains like  and , they publish at usernames like  and  allocated by a social media company. The things they publish are not HTML pages, but app-specific entities such as profiles, posts, comments, likes, and so on.These entities are usually stored in a database on the social company’s servers. The most common way to visualize a database is as a sequence of rows, but you could also visualize it as a graph. This makes it look very similar to web itself:What does this social graph enable that a web of personal sites doesn’t?The advantage of storing structured app-specific entities, such as posts and likes, instead of HTML documents is obvious. App-specific entities such as posts and likes have a richer structure: you can always turn them  HTML documents later, but you can  aggregate them, filter them, query, sort, and recombine them in different ways before that. This allows you to create many projections of the same data—a profile page, a list of posts, an individual post with comments.Where this really shines, though, is when many people use  social app. Since everyone’s public content is now in a single database, it is easy to aggregate  content published by many people. This enables social features like global search, notifications, feeds, personalized algorithms, shared moderation, etc.It’s specifically this  that blows the “personal sites” paradigm out of the water. People are social creatures, and we want to congregate in shared spaces. We don’t just want to visit each other’s sites—we want to hang out , and social apps provide the shared infrastructure. Social aggregation features like notifications, feeds, and search are non-negotiable in modern social products.Today, the most common way to implement these features is shaped like this:There still  a web-like logical model of our data—our profiles, our posts, our follows, our likes, all the things that we’ve created—but it lives  some social app’s database. What’s exposed to the web are only  of that model—the Home screen, the Notifications screen, the HTML pages for individual posts.This architecture makes sense. It is the easiest way to evolve the “personal sites” paradigm to support aggregation so it’s not surprising today’s apps have largely converged on it. People create accounts on social apps, which lets those apps build aggregated features, which entices more people to sign up for those apps.However, something got lost in the process. The web we’re actually creating—our posts, our follows, our likes—is no longer meaningfully ours. Even though much of what we’re creating is public, it is not a part of the open web. We can’t change our “hosting provider” because we’re now  from how the internet works. We, and the web we create, have become rows in somebody else’s database:This creates an imbalance.When Alice used to publish her stuff on , she was not tied to any particular hosting provider. If she were unhappy with a hosting provider, she knew that she could swap it out without losing any traffic or breaking any links:That kept the hosting providers in check.But now that Alice publishes her stuff on a social media platform, she can no longer “walk away” without losing something. If she signs up to another social platform, she would be  to start from scratch, even if she  to retain her connections. There is no way for Alice to sever the relationship with a particular app without ripping herself, and anything she created there, out of its social graph:The web Alice created—who she follows, what she likes, what she has posted—is trapped in a box that’s owned by somebody else. To leave is to leave it .On an individual level, it might not be a huge deal.Alice can rebuild her social presence connection by connection somewhere else. Eventually she might even have the same reach as on the previous platform.However, , the net effect is that social platforms—at first, gradually, and then suddenly—turn their backs on their users. If you can’t leave without losing something important, the platform has no incentives to respect you as a user.Maybe the app gets squeezed by investors, and every third post is an ad. Maybe it gets bought by a congolomerate that wanted to get rid of competition, and is now on life support. Maybe it runs out of funding, and your content goes down in two days. Maybe the founders get acquihired—an exciting new chapter. Maybe the app was bought by some guy, and now you’re slowly getting cooked by the algorithm.If your next platform doesn’t respect you as a user, you might try to leave it, too.But what are you going to do? Will you “export your data”? What will you do with that lonely shard of a social graph? You can upload it somewhere as an archive but it’s ripped out of its social context—a pitiful memento of your self-imposed exile.Those megabytes of JSON you got on your way out are . It’s like a branch torn apart from its tree. It doesn’t  anywhere. To give a new life to our data, we’d have to  export it and then  import it into some next agreed-upon social app—a near-impossible feat of coordination. Even then, the network effects are so strong that most people would soon find their way back.You can’t  a social app without  the web you’ve created.What if you could keep it?Alice and Bob are still using social apps. Those apps don’t look much different from today’s social apps. You could hardly tell that something has changed.Something has changed, though. (Can you spot it?)Notice that Alice’s handle is now . It is not allocated by a social media company. Rather, her handle is  universal “internet handle”, i.e. a domain. Alice  the  domain, so she can  on any open social app. (On most open social apps, she goes by , but for others she wants a distinct disconnected identity, so she owns another handle she’d rather not share.)Bob owns a domain too, even though he isn’t technical. He might not even know what a “domain” is. Bob just thinks of  as his “internet handle”. Some open social apps will offer you a free subdomain on registration, just like Gmail gives you a free Gmail address, or may offer an extra flow for buying a domain. You’re not locked into your first choice, and can swap to a different domain later.Your internet handle being something you  is the most user-visible aspect of open social apps. But the much bigger difference is invisible to the user.When you previously saw the social graph above, it was trapped  a social app’s database. There was a box around that graph—it wasn’t a part of the web. With open social, Alice’s data—her posts, likes, follows, etc— hosted on the web itself. Alongside her personal site, Alice now has a  of her data:This “repository” is a regular web server that implements the AT Protocol spec. The only job of Alice’s personal repository is to store and serve data created by Alice in the form of signed JSON. Alice is technical, so she likes to sometimes inspect her repo using open source tools like pdsls, Taproot, or atproto-browser.Bob, however, isn’t technical. He doesn’t even know that there is a “repository” with his “data”. He got a repository behind the scenes when he signed up for his first open social app. His repository stores  data (from all open social apps).Have another look at this picture:These aren’t rows in somebody’s database. This is a web of hyperlinked JSON. Just like every HTML page has an  URI so other pages can link to it, every JSON record has an  URI, so any other JSON record can link to it. (On this and other illustrations,  is a shorthand for .) The  protocol is a bunch of conventions on top of DNS, HTTP, and JSON.Now have a look at the arrows between their records. Alice follows Bob, so she has a  record linking to Bob’s  record. Bob commented on Alice’s post, so he has a  record that links to Alice’s  record. Alice liked his comment, so she has a  record with a link to his  record. Everything Alice creates stays in her repo under her control, everything Bob creates stays in his repo under his control, and links express the connections—just like in HTML.All of this happens behind the scenes and is invisibile to a non-technical user. The user doesn’t need to think about where their data is stored until it matters, just like the user doesn’t think about how servers work when navigating the web.Alice’s and Bob’s repositories could be hosted on the same machine. Or they could be hosted by different companies or communities. Maybe Alice is self-hosting her repository, while Bob uses a free hosting service that came by default with his first open social app. They may even be running completely differentimplementations. If both servers follow the AT protocol, they can participate in this web of JSON.Note that  and  do not need to resolve to the same server. This is intentional so that having a nice handle like  doesn’t  Alice to host her own data, to mess with her website, or even to  a site at all. If she owns , she can point  at any server.If Alice is unhappy with her hosting, she can pack up and leave:(This requires a modicum of technical skill today but it’s getting more accessible.)Just like with moving a personal site, changing where her repo is being served from doesn’t require cooperation from the previous host. It also doesn’t disrupt her ability to log into apps and doesn’t break any links. The web repairs itself:It is worth pausing for a moment to appreciate what we have here.Every bit of public data that Alice and Bob created—their posts, their likes, their comments, their recipes, their scrobbles—is meaningfully owned by them. It’s not in a database subject to some CEO’s whims, but hosted  on the open web, with ability to “walk away” without losing traffic or breaking any links.Like the web of personal sites, this model is centered around the user.What does it mean for apps?Each open social app is like a CMS (content management system) for a subset of data that lives in its users’ repositories. In that sense, your personal repository serves a role akin to a Google account, a Dropbox folder, or a Git repository, with data from your different open social apps grouped under different “subfolders”.When you make a post on Bluesky, Bluesky puts that post into  repo:When you star a project on Tangled, Tangled puts that star into  repo:When you create a publication on Leaflet, Leaflet puts it into  repo:Over time, your repo grows to be a collection of data from different open social apps. This data is open by default—if you wanted to look at my Bluesky posts, or Tangled stars, or Leaflet publications, you wouldn’t need to hit these applications’ APIs. You could just hit my personal repository and enumerate all of its records.To avoid naming collisions, the data in the repository is grouped by the format:In any user’s repo, Bluesky posts go with other Bluesky posts, Leaflet publications go with Leaflet publications, Tangled stars go with Tangled stars, and so on. Each data format is controlled and evolved by developers of the relevant application.I’ve drawn a dotted line to separate them but perhaps this is misleading.Since the data from different apps “lives together”, there’s a much lower barrier for open social apps to piggyback on each other’s data. In a way, it starts to feel like a connected multiverse of apps, with data from one app “bleeding into” other apps.When I signed up for Tangled, I chose to use my existing  handle. That makes sense since identity can be shared between open social apps. What’s more interesting is that Tangled  my avatar based on my Bluesky profile. It didn’t need to hit the Bluesky API to do that; it just read the Bluesky profile record in my repository. Every app can choose to piggyback on data from other apps.That might remind you of Gravatar, but it works for . Every open social app can take advantage of data created by every other open social app:There is no API to hit, no integrations to build, nothing to get locked out of. All the data is in the user’s repository, so you can parse it (as typed JSON), and use it.This has deep implications for the lifecycle of products. If a product gets shut down, the data doesn’t disappear. It’s still in its users’ repos. Someone can build a replacement that makes this data comes back to life. Someone can build a new product that incorporates  of that data, or lets users choose what to import. Someone can build an alternative projection of existing data—This also reduces the “cold start” problem for new apps. If some of the data you care about already exists on the network, you can bootstrap your product off of that. For example, if you’re launching a short video app, you can piggyback on the Bluesky  records so that people don’t have to find each other again. But if that doesn’t make sense for your app, you can have your own  records instead, or offer a one-time import. All existing data is up for reuse and remixing.Some open social apps are explicitly based  this sort of remixing. Anisota is primarily a Bluesky client, but it natively supports showing Leaflet documents. Popfeed can cross-post reviews to both Bluesky and Leaflet. If Leaflet does get very popular, there’s nothing stopping Bluesky itself from supporting a Leaflet document as another type of post attachment. In fact, some third-party Bluesky client could decide to do that first, and the official one could eventually follow.This is why I like “open social” as a term.Open social frees up our data like open source freed up our code. Open social ensures that old data can get a new life, that people can’t be locked out of the web they’ve created, and that products can be forked and remixed. You don’t need an “everything app” when data from different apps circulates in the open web.If you’re technical, by now you might have a burning question.How the hell does aggregation work?!Since every user’s records live in  repository, there could be millions (potentially billions?) of repositories. How can an app efficiently query, sort, filter, and aggregate information from them? Surely it can’t search them on demand.I’ve previously used a CMS as an analogy—for example, a blogging app could directly write posts to your repository and then read posts from it when someone visits your blog. This “singleplayer” use case would not require aggregation at all.To avoid hitting the user’s repository every time you want to display their blog post, you can connect to the user’s repository by a websocket. Every time a record relevant to your app is created, updated, or deleted, you can update your database:This database isn’t the  for user’s data—it’s more like an app-specific cache that lets you avoid going to the user repo whenever you need some data.Coincidentally, that’s the exact mechanism you would use for aggregation. You listen to events from all of your app users’ repositories, write them to a local database, and query that database as much as you like with zero extra latency.This might remind you of how Google Reader crawls RSS (rip).To avoid opening a million event socket connections, it makes sense to listen to a stream that retransmits events from all known repositories on the network:You can then filter down such a stream to just the events you’re interested in, and then update your local database in response to the events your app cares about.For example, Leaflet is only interested in events concerning  records. However, Leaflet can also  to listen to other events. If Leaflet wanted to add a feature that shows backlinks to Bluesky discussions of a Leaflet document, it would simply start tracking  records too. (Edit: I’ve been informed that Leaflet already does this to display quotes from Bluesky.)You can see the combined event stream from every known repository here:This is a realtime stream of every single event on the network. It’s dominated by  records because Bluesky is the most-used app, but you can filter it down to other record types. This retransmitter (called a “relay”) is operated by Bluesky, but you don’t have to depend on it. The Blacksky community runs their own relay implementation at , which you can try here. It doesn’t matter which relay is used by which app—everyone “sees” the same web.An important detail is that commits are cryptographically signed, which means that you don’t need to trust a relay or a cache of network data. You can verify that the records haven’t been tampered with, and each commit is legitimate. This is why “AT” in “AT Protocol” stands for “authenticated transfer”. You’re supposed to pronounce it like “@” (“at”) though. Don’t say “ay-tee” or you’ll embarrass me!As time goes by, we’ll see more infrastructure built around and for open social apps. Graze is letting users build their own algorithmic feeds, and Slices is an upcoming developer platform that does large-scale repository indexing for you. Constellation and If This Then AT:// offer easy network querying and automation.These are all technical details, though.What matters is the big picture.The pre-social web of “personalized sites” got data ownership, hosting independence, and linking right. Alice and Bob fully participate in the web:The closed social web innovated in scaling and in social aggregation features. Notifications, search, and feeds are non-negotiable in modern social products:However, the closed social web has also excluded  from the web.  is no longer meaningfully ours. We’re just rows in somebody else’s database.Open social frees the web we’re creating from somebody else’s boxes. Our profiles, likes, follows, recipes, scrobbles, and other content meaningfully belong to us:The data no longer lives  the products; the products  our data:This blurs the boundaries between apps. Every open social app can use, remix, link to, and riff on data from every other open social app.The web we’ve created remains after the products we used to create it are gone. Developers can build new products to recontextualize it. No one can take it away.People might not ever start using technical concepts like “decentralization” but they do understand when data from one app can seamlessly flow into other apps.People might not care about “federation” but they do notice when they log into a competing product, and their data is , and their reach is intact.And people  understand when they’re being fucked with.For a long time, open social will rely on a community of stubborn enthusiasts who see the promise of the approach and are willing to bear the pains of building (and failing) in a new ecosystem. But I don’t think that dooms the effort. That’s the history of every big community-driven change. Somebody has to work through the kinks. Like with open source, open social is a compounding effort. Every mildly successful open social app lifts all open social apps. Every piece of shared infrastructure can benefit somebody else. At some point, open is bound to win.I just hope it doesn’t take thirty five years.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Transnistria: Caught between Russia and the EU | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fblgbUI7t0</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/8fblgbUI7t0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Officially, Transnistria is part of the Republic of Moldova. But in practice, it is a state within a state. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the region seceded in a bloody civil war. It has its own flag, currency and government.

The self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria is not internationally recognized. But it has been closely intertwined with Russia politically, economically and militarily for decades. Some 1,500 Russian soldiers are permanently stationed in the region. In spring 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there were explosions and attacks on government buildings.
Since the Republic of Moldova was granted EU accession candidate status in 2022, the long-forgotten region has once again become the focus of geopolitical power games. 
While the Moldovan capital Chişinău tends to pursue a more pro-European course, many people in Transnistria cling to Russia - despite problems like Transnistria‘s deep poverty. The region's economy is dominated by a powerful network of oligarchs. Critics speak of a system of mutual protection between business, politics and pro-Russian power structures.
Until the beginning of 2025, Transnistria's economy was reliant on gas from Russia. A fragile balancing act - as some 80 percent of Transnistria’s exports go to the EU. But the energy crisis that followed the gas freeze has exacerbated tensions in the region. 
While pro-Russian actors want to expand their power, supporters of a pro-European course are focusing on greater integration into the EU.

Is America Closing the Door on Global Talent?
Donald Trump’s new $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, universities, and foreign governments. In this video, we unpack the legal, economic, and political fallout — from panics at airports to diplomatic blowback, from the Hyundai factory raid to the eerie silence of Silicon Valley CEOs. Is this the end of skilled immigration as we know it? Or just another chapter in America’s long-running immigration drama?

We’ll explore:

What the H-1B visa is and why it matters
How the fee could reshape tech hiring, university admissions, and global talent flows
The legal challenges ahead and the industrial policy contradictions
Why CEOs are staying quiet — and what that silence says
The growing divide between MAGA populism and tech elite pragmatism

There are a couple of reasons for this, but one of them is a disastrous project to replace the city's income management system using Oracle. The cost of this has risen to $230 million, while the initial estimate was $24 million. There was a failed rollout of the new system earlier this year. "Original plans for the replacement of SAP with Oracle Fusion set aside a 19.965 million-euro budget for three years implementation until the end of the 2021 financial year," reports The Register. "Go-live date was later put back until April 2022 and the budget increased to 40 million euros.

more powerful Go execution traces. In that blog post
we gave a sneak peek into some of the new functionality we could unlock with our new execution
tracer, including . We’re happy to announce that flight recording is now
available in Go 1.25, and it’s a powerful new tool in the Go diagnostics toolbox.First, a quick recap on Go execution traces.The Go runtime can be made to write a log recording many of the events that happen during
the execution of a Go application. That log is called a runtime execution trace.
Go execution traces contain a plethora of information about how goroutines interact with each
other and the underlying system. This makes them very handy for debugging latency issues, since
they tell you both when your goroutines are executing, and crucially, when they are not.The runtime/trace package provides an API for collecting
an execution trace over a given time window by calling  and .
This works well if the code you’re tracing is just a test, microbenchmark, or command line
tool. You can collect a trace of the complete end-to-end execution, or just the parts you care about.However, in long-running web services, the kinds of applications Go is known for, that’s not
good enough. Web servers might be up for days or even weeks, and collecting a trace of the
entire execution would produce far too much data to sift through. Often just one part
of the program’s execution goes wrong, like a request timing out or a failed health
check. By the time it happens it’s already too late to call !One way to approach this problem is to randomly sample execution traces from across the fleet.
While this approach is powerful, and can help find issues before they become outages, it
requires a lot of infrastructure to get going. Large quantities of execution trace data
would need to be stored, triaged, and processed, much of which won’t contain anything
interesting at all. And when you’re trying to get to the bottom of a specific issue,
it’s a non-starter.This brings us to the flight recorder.A program often knows when something has gone wrong, but the root cause may have happened
long ago. The flight recorder lets you collect a trace of the last few seconds of
execution leading up to the moment a program detects there’s been a problem.The flight recorder collects the execution trace as normal, but instead of writing it out to
a socket or a file, it buffers the last few seconds of the trace in memory. At any point,
the program can request the contents of the buffer and snapshot exactly the problematic
window of time. The flight recorder is like a scalpel cutting directly to the problem area.Let’s learn how to use the flight recorder with an example. Specifically, let’s use it to
diagnose a performance problem with an HTTP server that implements a “guess the number” game.
It exposes a  endpoint that accepts an integer and responds to the caller
informing them if they guessed the right number. There is also a goroutine that, once per
minute, sends a report of all the guessed numbers to another service via an HTTP request.// bucket is a simple mutex-protected counter.
type bucket struct {
    mu      sync.Mutex
    guesses int
}

func main() {
    // Make one bucket for each valid number a client could guess.
    // The HTTP handler will look up the guessed number in buckets by
    // using the number as an index into the slice.
    buckets := make([]bucket, 100)

    // Every minute, we send a report of how many times each number was guessed.
    go func() {
        for range time.Tick(1 * time.Minute) {
            sendReport(buckets)
        }
    }()

    // Choose the number to be guessed.
    answer := rand.Intn(len(buckets))

    http.HandleFunc("/guess-number", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        start := time.Now()

        // Fetch the number from the URL query variable "guess" and convert it
        // to an integer. Then, validate it.
        guess, err := strconv.Atoi(r.URL.Query().Get("guess"))
        if err != nil || !(0 <= guess && guess < len(buckets)) {
            http.Error(w, "invalid 'guess' value", http.StatusBadRequest)
            return
        }

        // Select the appropriate bucket and safely increment its value.
        b := &buckets[guess]
        b.mu.Lock()
        b.guesses++
        b.mu.Unlock()

        // Respond to the client with the guess and whether it was correct.
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "guess: %d, correct: %t", guess, guess == answer)

        log.Printf("HTTP request: endpoint=/guess-number guess=%d duration=%s", guess, time.Since(start))
    })
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8090", nil))
}

// sendReport posts the current state of buckets to a remote service.
func sendReport(buckets []bucket) {
    counts := make([]int, len(buckets))

    for index := range buckets {
        b := &buckets[index]
        b.mu.Lock()
        defer b.mu.Unlock()

        counts[index] = b.guesses
    }

    // Marshal the report data into a JSON payload.
    b, err := json.Marshal(counts)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("failed to marshal report data: error=%s", err)
        return
    }
    url := "http://localhost:8091/guess-number-report"
    if _, err := http.Post(url, "application/json", bytes.NewReader(b)); err != nil {
        log.Printf("failed to send report: %s", err)
    }
}
Let’s suppose that after deploying the application in production, we received complaints from
users that some  calls were taking longer than expected. When we look at our
logs, we see that sometimes response times exceed 100 milliseconds, while the majority of calls
are on the order of microseconds.2025/09/19 16:52:02 HTTP request: endpoint=/guess-number guess=69 duration=625ns
2025/09/19 16:52:02 HTTP request: endpoint=/guess-number guess=62 duration=458ns
2025/09/19 16:52:02 HTTP request: endpoint=/guess-number guess=42 duration=1.417µs
2025/09/19 16:52:02 HTTP request: endpoint=/guess-number guess=86 duration=115.186167ms
2025/09/19 16:52:02 HTTP request: endpoint=/guess-number guess=0 duration=127.993375ms
Before we continue, take a minute and see if you can spot what’s wrong!Regardless of whether you found the problem or not, let’s dive deeper and see how we can
find the problem from first principles. In particular, it would be great if we could see
what the application was doing in the time leading up to the slow response. This is exactly
what the flight recorder was built for! We’ll use it to capture an execution trace once
we see the first response exceeding 100 milliseconds.First, in , we’ll configure and start the flight recorder:// Set up the flight recorder
fr := trace.NewFlightRecorder(trace.FlightRecorderConfig{
    MinAge:   200 * time.Millisecond,
    MaxBytes: 1 << 20, // 1 MiB
})
fr.Start()
 configures the duration for which trace data is reliably retained, and we
suggest setting it to around 2x the time window of the event. For example, if you
are debugging a 5-second timeout, set it to 10 seconds.  configures the
size of the buffered trace so you don’t blow up your memory usage.  On average,
you can expect a few MB of trace data to be produced per second of execution,
or 10 MB/s for a busy service.Next, we’ll add a helper function to capture the snapshot and write it to a file:var once sync.Once

// captureSnapshot captures a flight recorder snapshot.
func captureSnapshot(fr *trace.FlightRecorder) {
    // once.Do ensures that the provided function is executed only once.
    once.Do(func() {
        f, err := os.Create("snapshot.trace")
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("opening snapshot file %s failed: %s", f.Name(), err)
            return
        }
        defer f.Close() // ignore error

        // WriteTo writes the flight recorder data to the provided io.Writer.
        _, err = fr.WriteTo(f)
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("writing snapshot to file %s failed: %s", f.Name(), err)
            return
        }

        // Stop the flight recorder after the snapshot has been taken.
        fr.Stop()
        log.Printf("captured a flight recorder snapshot to %s", f.Name())
    })
}
And finally, just before logging a completed request, we’ll trigger the snapshot if the request
took more than 100 milliseconds:// Capture a snapshot if the response takes more than 100ms.
// Only the first call has any effect.
if fr.Enabled() && time.Since(start) > 100*time.Millisecond {
    go captureSnapshot(fr)
}
Now, we run the server again and send requests until we get a slow request that triggers a
snapshot.Once we’ve gotten a trace, we’ll need a tool that will help us examine it. The Go toolchain
provides a built-in execution trace analysis tool via the
 command. Run go tool trace snapshot.trace to
launch the tool, which starts a local web server, then open the displayed URL in your browser
(if the tool doesn’t open your browser automatically).This tool gives us a few ways to look at the trace, but let’s focus on visualizing the trace
to get a sense of what’s going on. Click “View trace by proc” to do so.In this view, the trace is presented as a timeline of events. At the top of the page, in
the “STATS” section, we can see a summary of the application’s state, including the
number of threads, the heap size, and the goroutine count.Below that, in the “PROCS” section, we can see how the execution of goroutines is mapped
onto  (the number of operating system threads created by the Go application). We
can see when and how each goroutine starts, runs, and finally stops executing.For now, let’s turn our attention to this massive gap in execution on the right side of the
viewer. For a period of time, around 100ms, nothing is happening!By selecting the  tool (or pressing ), we can inspect the section of the trace right
after the gap with more detail.In addition to the activity of each individual goroutine, we can see how goroutines interact
via “flow events.” An incoming flow event indicates what happened to make a goroutine start
running. An outgoing flow edge indicates what effect one goroutine had on another. Enabling the
visualization of all flow events often provides clues that hint at the source of a problem.In this case, we can see that many of the goroutines have a direct connection to a single
goroutine right after the pause in activity.Clicking on the the single goroutine shows an event table filled with outgoing flow events, which
matches what we saw when the flow view was enabled.What happened when this goroutine ran? Part of the information stored in the trace is a view
of the stack trace at different points in time. When we look at the goroutine we can see that
the start stack trace shows that it was waiting for the HTTP request to complete when the
goroutine was scheduled to run. And the end stack trace shows that the  function
had already returned and it was waiting for the ticker for the next scheduled time to send
the report.Between the start and the end of this goroutine running, we see a huge number of
“outgoing flows,” where it interacts with other goroutines. Clicking on one of the
 entries takes us to a view of the interaction.This flow implicates the  in :for index, b := range buckets {
    b.mu.Lock()
    defer b.mu.Unlock()

    counts[index] = b.value
}
In , we intended to acquire a lock on each bucket and release the lock after
copying the value.But here’s the problem: we don’t actually release the lock immediately after copying the
value contained in . Because we used a  statement to release the
lock, that release doesn’t happen until the function returns. We hold the lock not just
past the end of the loop, but until after the HTTP request completes. That’s a subtle
error that may be difficult to track down in a large production system.Fortunately, execution tracing helped us pinpoint the problem. However, if we tried
to use the execution tracer in a long-running server without the new flight-recording
mode, it would likely amass a huge amount of execution trace data, which an operator
would have to store, transmit, and sift through. The flight recorder gives us the power
of hindsight. It lets us capture just what went wrong, after it’s already happened,
and quickly zero in on the cause.The flight recorder is just the latest addition to the Go developer’s toolbox for
diagnosing the inner workings of running applications. We’ve steadily been improving
tracing over the past couple of releases. Go 1.21 greatly reduced the run-time overhead
of tracing. The trace format became more robust and also splittable in the Go 1.22
release, leading to features like the flight recorder. Open-source tools like
gotraceui, and the forthcoming ability to programmatically
parse execution traces are more ways to leverage the power of
execution traces. The Diagnostics page lists many additional
tools at your disposal. We hope you make use of them as you write and refine
your Go applications.We’d like to take a moment to thank those community members who have been active in the
diagnostics meetings, contributed to the designs, and provided feedback over the years:

and PJ Malloy (@thepudds).The discussions, feedback, and work you’ve all put in have been instrumental in pushing
us to a better diagnostics future.

To EA's credit, it's a pretty good upgrade, all things considered. This is partly due to how off the mark EA FC 25 was, but also because of a concerted effort to solve some of the series' longstanding issues by focusing on player feedback. The end result is an interesting attempt to appeal to every type of player. It's not wholly successful in this ambition, but EA FC 26 is at least a step in the right direction.The headlining change is a shift to two distinct playstyles. The series has always felt somewhat different when played online compared to offline, but the feeling is now much more pronounced and extends beyond the foibles of online netcode. Competitive and Authentic gameplay presets make a marked difference in how the match engine handles. You can choose between either one when playing offline, but online modes, such as Ultimate Team, are locked into the Competitive playstyle (even when playing Squad Battles against the CPU).The Competitive preset is all about player skill. The pace of the game is rapid, with passes ping-ponging between players' feet, and the spotlight is on dribbling, skill moves, and consistently high-scoring matches. Despite this proclivity for attacking football, defending has also been improved. Successful tackles actually regain possession, rather than knocking the ball right back to the attacking player's feet, so a lot of the frustration from previous entries has been exorcised.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Dark Side Of The Freemasons: 600-Years Of Conspiracy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7xriwQ3-_w</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/H7xriwQ3-_w?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 21:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Freemason Conspiracy: Unmasking The Secret Brotherhood

OpenAI calls it "personalized research and timely updates that appear regularly to keep you informed."ChatGPT Pulse works by analyzing a user's chat history, saved preferences, and optional connections to Gmail and Google Calendar each night. The next morning, users receive visual "cards" (small illustrated squares with topic summaries that can be expanded for detail) containing updates on topics the model determines are relevant, such as project follow-ups, dinner suggestions, or travel recommendations. Users can provide feedback through thumbs up or down ratings and request specific topics through a "curate" button.OpenAI says that rather than waiting for users to initiate conversations, ChatGPT now attempts to deliver information preemptively using what OpenAI calls "asynchronous research," essentially having the model generate queries and responses overnight using traditional methods.

It now produces more concise answers, a key factor in reducing token costs and latency for high-throughput applications (see charts above).Stronger multimodal & translation capabilities: This update features more accurate audio transcription, better image understanding, and improved translation quality.You can start testing this version today using the following model string: gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025.This latest 2.5 Flash model comes with improvements in two key areas we heard consistent feedback on: We've improved how the model uses tools, leading to better performance in more complex, agentic and multi-step applications. This model shows noticeable improvements on key agentic benchmarks, including a 5% gain on SWE-Bench Verified, compared to our last release (48.9% → 54%). With thinking on, the model is now significantly more cost-efficient—achieving higher quality outputs while using fewer tokens, reducing latency and cost (see charts above).We’re already seeing positive feedback from early testers. As Yichao ‘Peak’ Ji, Co-Founder & Chief Scientist at Manus, an autonomous AI agent, noted: “The new Gemini 2.5 Flash model offers a remarkable blend of speed and intelligence. Our evaluation on internal benchmarks revealed a 15% leap in performance for long-horizon agentic tasks. Its outstanding cost-efficiency enables Manus to scale to unprecedented levels—advancing our mission to Extend Human Reach.”You can start testing this preview version today by using the following model string: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025.Start building with GeminiOver the last year, we’ve learned that shipping preview versions of our models allows you to test our latest improvements and innovations, provide feedback, and build production-ready experiences with the best of Gemini. Today’s releases are not intended to graduate to a new, stable version but will help us shape our future stable releases, and allow us to continue iterating and bring you the best of Gemini.To make it even easier to access our latest models while also reducing the need to keep track of long model string names, we are also introducing a alias for each model family. This alias always points to our most recent model versions, allowing you to experiment with new features without needing to update your code for each release. You can access the new previews using:To ensure you have time to test new models, we will always provide a 2-week notice (via email) before we make updates or deprecate a specific version behind . These are just model aliases so the rate limits, cost, and features available may fluctuate between releases.For applications that require more stability, continue to use  and .We continue to push the frontier of what is possible with Gemini and this release is just another step in that direction.

But thanks to his tireless commitment to peace and human rights, he is also one of the most famous personalities in contemporary history.

This documentary tells the story of how the son of a simple farming family became the spiritual leader of the Tibetans. At the age of just four years old, Lhamo Dhondup became the 14th Dalai Lama. He journeyed to the capital of Tibet, Lhasa. From then on, he was constantly surrounded by an entourage. His childhood was over. 
When the People's Republic of China was founded, Mao Zedong announced that he also wanted to "liberate” Tibet. In 1950, Chinese troops advanced into Lhasa and occupied the country. The film shows the Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959 -- the result of years of oppression by Chinese rulers.
For decades now, the Dalai Lama has led the Tibetan government in exile from Dharamsala, India. He has also traveled the world as a peace activist. He celebrated his 90th birthday in July 2025. Observers speculate that China will exert its influence in the appointment of a successor. The consequences for Tibet are unforeseeable.

The deadliest virus on our planet only feasts on bacteria, aptly named: Bacteriophage - bacteria eater. Now that our antibiotics aren't as effective against the ever-evolving multiresistant bacteria, phages are a promising tool for defending ourselves in the future. They are highly specialized so they only attack the bacteria they’re supposed to, reducing the side effects of a treatment.

This enhances
the Kubernetes storage ecosystem by providing an efficient way for
CSI storage drivers to identify changed
blocks in PersistentVolume snapshots. With a driver that can use the feature, you could benefit
from faster and more resource-efficient backup operations.What is changed block tracking?Changed block tracking enables storage systems to identify and track modifications at the block level
between snapshots, eliminating the need to scan entire volumes during backup operations. The
improvement is a change to the Container Storage Interface (CSI), and also to the storage support
in Kubernetes itself.
With the alpha feature enabled, your cluster can:Identify allocated blocks within a CSI volume snapshotDetermine changed blocks between two snapshots of the same volumeStreamline backup operations by focusing only on changed data blocksFor Kubernetes users managing large datasets, this API enables significantly more efficient
backup processes. Backup applications can now focus only on the blocks that have changed,
rather than processing entire volumes.As of now, the Changed Block Tracking API is supported only for block volumes and not for
file volumes. CSI drivers that manage file-based storage systems will not be able to
implement this capability.Benefits of changed block tracking support in KubernetesAs Kubernetes adoption grows for stateful workloads managing critical data, the need for efficient
backup solutions becomes increasingly important. Traditional full backup approaches face challenges with:: Full volume backups can take hours for large datasets, making it difficult
to complete within maintenance windows.High resource utilization: Backup operations consume substantial network bandwidth and I/O
resources, especially for large data volumes and data-intensive applications.: Repetitive full backups store redundant data, causing storage
requirements to grow linearly even when only a small percentage of data actually changes between
backups.The Changed Block Tracking API addresses these challenges by providing native Kubernetes support for
incremental backup capabilities through the CSI interface.The implementation consists of three primary components:CSI SnapshotMetadata Service API: An API, offered by gRPC, that provides volume
snapshot and changed block data.SnapshotMetadataService API: A Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) that
advertises CSI driver metadata service availability and connection details to
cluster clients.External Snapshot Metadata Sidecar: An intermediary component that connects CSI
drivers to backup applications via a standardized gRPC interface.Implementation requirementsStorage provider responsibilitiesIf you're an author of a storage integration with Kubernetes and want to support the changed block tracking feature, you must implement specific requirements:: Storage providers need to implement the  service as defined in the CSI specifications protobuf. This service requires server-side streaming implementations for the following RPCs:: For identifying allocated blocks in a snapshot: For determining changed blocks between two snapshotsStorage backend capabilities: Ensure the storage backend has the capability to track and report block-level changes.Deploy external components: Integrate with the external-snapshot-metadata sidecar to expose the snapshot metadata service.: Register the  resource using a CustomResourceDefinition and create a  custom resource that advertises the availability of the metadata service and provides connection details.: Implement proper error handling for these RPCs according to the CSI specification requirements.Backup solution responsibilitiesA backup solution looking to leverage this feature must:: The backup application must provide a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token when using the
Kubernetes SnapshotMetadataService API.
Appropriate access grants, such as RBAC RoleBindings, must be established to authorize the backup application
ServiceAccount to obtain such tokens.Implement streaming client-side code: Develop clients that implement the streaming gRPC APIs defined in the
schema.proto file.
Specifically:Implement streaming client code for  and  methodsHandle server-side streaming responses efficiently as the metadata comes in chunksProcess the  message format with proper error handlingThe external-snapshot-metadata GitHub repository provides a convenient
iterator
support package to simplify client implementation.Handle large dataset streaming: Design clients to efficiently handle large streams of block metadata that
could be returned for volumes with significant changes.Optimize backup processes: Modify backup workflows to use the changed block metadata to identify and only
transfer changed blocks to make backups more efficient, reducing both backup duration and resource consumption.To use changed block tracking in your cluster:Ensure your CSI driver supports volume snapshots and implements the snapshot metadata capabilities with the required external-snapshot-metadata sidecarMake sure the SnapshotMetadataService custom resource is registered using CRDVerify the presence of a SnapshotMetadataService custom resource for your CSI driverCreate clients that can access the API using appropriate authentication (via Kubernetes ServiceAccount tokens)The API provides two main functions:: Lists blocks allocated in a single snapshot: Lists blocks changed between two snapshotsDepending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes developers hope to push the CSI Snapshot Metadata implementation to Beta in the future releases.For those interested in trying out this new feature:This project, like all of Kubernetes, is the result of hard work by many contributors from diverse backgrounds working together.

When Khotun Khan and his Mongolian army attack Jin's home island of Tsushima, the samurai is unable to repel the invading force as the noble warrior he was forged to be, and must instead sever his honor by becoming the fearsome "Ghost." Yet adopting underhanded tactics to gain the edge comes at a cost, as Jin is forced to grapple with sacrificing his relationships, his moral code, and everything he once stood for in an effort to defeat an unconventional foe.In Ghost of Yotei, protagonist Atsu doesn't have to make such choices. She's not a samurai, but a wandering mercenary from an ignoble family--a family that was slaughtered at the hands of a gang of violent outlaws known as the Yotei Six. With everything taken from her, Atsu's gender and lowly status mean she has no fixed standing in Japanese society during the early 1600s.Alone and consumed by revenge, she carves her own path forward, adopting the mantle of the onryo, a vengeful spirit from Japanese folklore that's able to inflict harm in the world of the living. Like Jin, Atsu becomes a symbol--one that strikes fear into the hearts of her enemies as her legend grows.

Today, we will explain Kafka by  what every word in that definition means. Every definition will start with the 💡 symbol. At the end, you will have a complete high-level understanding of Apache Kafka.He’s an Apache Kafka committer and software engineer who worked at Confluent (the Kafka company) during its hypergrowth period. Check out his newsletter and social media:Currently, he has taken a break from engineering to consult companies and write extensively about Apache Kafka and data engineering.Apache Kafka is one of the most popular open-source projects in the data infrastructure space. It is a standard tool in every data engineer’s catalog, used by over 70% of Fortune 500 companies and 150,000 organizations.Kafka is a messaging system that was originally developed by LinkedIn in 2010. In 2011, it was open-sourced and donated to the Apache Foundation.Today, Confluent is a public company and widely known as the company behind Kafka. It has expanded its business to offer a more complete data streaming platform on top of Kafka.Nowadays, Kafka is more than a simple messaging system: it’s a larger ecosystem of components that form a. It is frequently called the swiss army knife of data infrastructure. is an AI code review tool that runs directly in your terminal. It provides intelligent code analysis, catches issues early, and integrates seamlessly with AI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor CLI, and Gemini to ensure your code is production-ready before it ships.Enables pre-commit reviews of both staged and unstaged changes, creating a multi-layered review process.Fits into existing Git workflows.

LinkedIn had to connect different services to one another. A naive way of achieving this would be to create many custom point-to-point integrations (called ) between each service. That would have resulted in an  mess that would break often and be impossible to maintain when N is in the hundredsApache Kafka flips this problem on its head. Instead of creating custom pipelines per connection, it encourages organizations to:Store their data in a central location (Kafka)Use a single standard API (the Kafka API)Have applications subscribe and consume this data in real timeThis decouples writers from readers, as writers simply publish to Kafka, and readers subscribe to Kafka.The data gets durably persisted to disk for a limited amount of time (e.g., 7 days). Kafka is ideal and was built with read-fanout use cases in mind, where the same message needs to get read by multiple systems. As such, it’s common for the system’s read throughput to be a multiple of its write throughput.💡 pub-sub messaging system (2/8) - this is what a pub/sub messaging system isWith Kafka, organizations don’t need to maintain dozens of fragile custom point-to-point pipelines that break whenever a single VM restarts. The data can be written to Kafka once and read as many times as necessary by whatever system needs it.In this article, we won’t talk further about the use cases of Kafka. If you’re more interested in the reason behind Kafka, I recently covered in-depth why LinkedIn created Kafka. It made the front page of Hacker News.Okay, let’s dive into Kafka now! To truly understand the system, we need to start from the basics.Let’s examine its core data structure:It is append-only; you can only add records to the end of the log (no deletes or updates allowed). Reads go from left to right, in the order the records were added.Each record in the log has a unique monotonically increasing number called an . The offset refers to the record and denotes its order.The API of the log data structure is very simple:Kafka keeps the log structure on disk. The log’s sequential operations work very well with HDDs. Hard drives offer very high throughput for sequential reads and writes. This differs from random reads and writes, where HDDs don’t perform well.: an entry in the log. I use these words interchangeably when describing data in Kafka.Each message is essentially a key-value pair; it consists of a `` and a `` (although other metadata like offset, timestamp, and custom headers exist too). The key is optional; it is valid for a message to only have a value.The key thing to remember is that the key/value pairs are .Kafka does not inherently support types (e.g., int64, string, etc.) nor schemas (specific message structures).It is the client-side code’s responsibility to apply schemas:: producer clients convert (serialize) the objects into bytes.: consumer clients parse (deserialize) the raw bytes from the network into the object.One log is not enough. You want to separate your data into categories. Just as in a database, you would create separate tables for user accounts and customer orders; in Kafka, you would create separate topics.It’s common for a Kafka cluster to have hundreds to thousands of topics.Kafka is a distributed system designed to scale much further than what a single machine can handle. As such, it uses .A topic is sharded into one or more partitions.Each partition is a separate instance of the log data structure.While a topic can have just one partition, it’s very common for it to have dozens, since this helps with parallelization of reads (more on that later).Kafka doesn’t use HTTP. It uses its own TCP-based protocol. This means that you need more custom code to send and receive requests; you can’t just use any HTTP library.Kafka provides its own libraries that implement the underlying protocol. The main clients you’d care about are the  and the .Producer: the class that’s used for writing data to KafkaConsumer: the class that’s used for reading data from KafkaThe Apache Kafka project offers a Java library that implements these:import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;

import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;The Producer class allows you to  to a topic. You can explicitly choose the partition or allow Kafka to do it automatically for you.The Consumer, on the other hand, lets you  to and the stream of messages coming in from a topic (or specific partition):This is simply the most important API I can show you concisely; a lot more exist. Kafka may seem simple, but it has many details to learn to be effective with it.Kafka as a Distributed SystemApache Kafka is designed to be a  system - one meant to scale horizontally by adding more nodes. As such, any normal deployment of Kafka consists of at least .: an instance of the Kafka server. This is what we call a node in the system.: all the brokers in the system.Kafka has a ton of interesting performance optimizations (more on this in another article). Its greatest strength is its horizontal scalability.The Log data structure is key to Kafka’s scalability - writes on it are O(1) and lock-free. This is because records are simply  and cannot be updated, nor individually deleted.Messages within a partition are independent of each other. They have no higher-level guarantees like unique keys. This reduces the need for locking and allows Kafka to append to the Log structure as fast as the disk will allow.Because each partition is a separate log, and you can add more brokers to the cluster, your scale is limited by how many brokers you can add.Nothing theoretically stops you from having a Kafka cluster that accepts and then scaling it 2x to .A partition in Kafka doesn’t live only on one broker - it is replicated across many.A configurable setting (called ) denotes how many copies should exist. The default and most common is .In other words, we have three copies (called ) of the Log data structure. These replicas live on the disks of different brokers.Replication is done for many reasons, one of which is data durability: when three copies of the data exist, one disk failing won’t lead to data loss.In modern cloud deployments, brokers are spread across different availability zones. This ensures very high durability and availability. Even in the unlikely event of a whole data center burning down, the Kafka cluster would still survive.Once you start maintaining copies of data in a distributed system, you open yourself to a lot of edge cases. Keeping new data in sync is tricky. The copies must match, and the system needs to somehow agree on the latest state.There is a whole class of complex algorithms in computer science called distributed consensus, which handle this.Kafka uses a straightforward single-leader replication model. At any time, one replica serves as the leader. The other two replicas act as followers (i.e., hot standbys).Only the leader accepts new writes - it serves as the source of truth of the log. The followers actively replicate data from the leader. Reads can be served from both the leader and its followers.When a broker node goes offline, the system notices it. Other brokers then take over the leadership of the partitions the dead broker led. This is how Kafka offers high availability.In a distributed system, all nodes must agree on the latest state of the cluster. Brokers must coordinate on certain metadata changes, like electing a new leader. This is again a distributed consensus problem. Because it’s too complex for the purposes of introducing Kafka, we will simply gloss over how Kafka solves it.Kafka uses a centralized coordination model. The central coordinator is none other than… .Kafka durably stores all metadata changes in a special  topic called . This storage model inherits all the benefits from topics. It gets fault-tolerance, durability, and most importantly for metadata, .Each record in the log represents a  (a delta). When replayed fully in the same order, a node can deterministically rebuild the same cluster end state.Here is a visual example of how it works in Kafka:In other words, the cluster metadata topic partition is the source of truth for the latest metadata in Kafka.Every broker in the cluster is subscribed to this topic. In real time, each broker pulls the latest committed updates. When a new record is fetched, the broker applies it to its in-memory metadata. This builds the broker’s idea of the latest state of the cluster.If every broker is a follower of the partition, a natural question arises - who is the leader? What node gets to decide what new metadata is written to this partition?Controllers serve as the control plane for a Kafka cluster. They’re special kinds of brokers that don’t host regular topics - they only do specific cluster-management operations. Usually, you’d deploy three controller brokers.At any one time, there is only one active controller - the leader of the log. Only the active controller can write to the log. The other controllers serve as hot standbys (followers).The active controller is responsible for making all metadata decisions in the cluster, like electing new partition leaders (when a broker dies), creating new topics, changing configs at runtime, etc.Most importantly, it’s responsible for determining broker liveness.Every broker issues  to the active controller. If a broker does not send heartbeats for 6 seconds straight, it is fenced off from the cluster by the controller. The controller then assigns other brokers to act as the leaders for the partitions the fenced (dead) broker led.The careful reader will now ask:If the active controller is responsible for electing partition leaders, who’s responsible for electing the  leader?The  partition is special. A custom distributed consensus algorithm is used to elect its leader.Leader election in a distributed system is a subset of the consensus problem. Many consensus algorithms exist, like Raft, Paxos, Zab, and so on.Kafka uses its own Raft-inspired algorithm called KRaft (Kafka Raft).Elect the active controller 👑The controller nodes comprise a Raft quorumThe quorum runs a Raft election protocol to elect a leader of the  partition. The leader of that partition is the active controllerAgree on the latest state of the metadata logMetadata updates are first appended to the Raft log on the active controller.They are marked committed only when a majority of the quorum has persisted them.The active controller determines the leaders for  regular topic partitions. It writes it to the metadata log, and once committed by the controller quorum, the decision is set in stone.In other words, the way leader election in Kafka works is:Leader election  (picking the active one) is done through a variant of Raft (KRaft)Leader election  is done through the controller.KRaft is a relatively recent algorithm in Apache Kafka. For many years, Kafka used ZooKeeper. Back then, there was just one controller. It performed the same tasks as today, but critically also had the responsibilities of a regular broker. Its decisions were persisted in ZooKeeper, which used the Zab consensus algorithm behind the scenes.This coordinator-based leader election model differs from other systems. For example, RedPanda uses a separate Raft quorum per partition.Other Features That Set Kafka ApartA key motivation in Kafka’s design was to add the ability to replay historical data and decouple data retention from clients. Alternative messaging systems would store messages as long as no client has consumed them, and once consumed, delete them.Kafka flips this model - it offers a simple time-based SLA as the message retention policy. A message is automatically deleted if it has been retained in the broker longer than a certain period, typically 7 days. The fact that the Log data structure’s O(1) performance doesn’t degrade with a larger data size makes this feasible.Through this model, Kafka offers the feature of  - the ability to reprocess old historical messages. That is extremely useful in cases where, for example, a consumer has had a dormant bug in it for a while and erroneously processed messages. When the bug is fixed, the correct logic can be rerun on the same messages.Unfortunately, at scale, it becomes extremely tricky to manage so much historical data. A cluster with 1 GB/s of producer bandwidth would collect 1,772 TB worth of data across the cluster. Even spread across 100 brokers, it’s still 17TB worth of data that each broker would have to host on its disk.❌ The system becomes inelastic. This happens because any action or incident requires a massive amount of data to be moved. That takes a long time.The Kafka community found an ingenious way to solve all these problems with one simple idea → outsource them to S3.While it may sound overly simple or lazy, it is an extremely elegant solution. S3 is a marvel of software engineering - it is maintained by hundreds of bright Amazon engineers. It is most likely the largest scale storage system known to man.Kafka uses a pluggable interface to store cold data in a secondary storage tier. All three cloud object stores are supported as the secondary tier, and you are free to extend it further.In essence, the data path in modern Kafka looks like this:: Write a message to a Kafka broker, which gets replicated across the replicas in the cluster. The message is stored on disk across all three nodes.The message is asynchronously offloaded to S3 (the secondary cold tier): After a configurable amount of time (e.g., 12 hours), the message is deleted from the brokers. Its only source of truth is left in S3. It expires from S3 after a separate configurable period.You can still read the cold historical data from Kafka using the regular APIs. The only change is that the broker now fetches it from S3 instead of its own disk. This results in slightly higher latencies when fetching historical data, but can be alleviated through caching. Latency for hot data can improve because it makes it cost-effective to deploy performant SSDs (instead of HDDs). Throughput remains the same very high number. Kafka as a system becomes much more elastic because it no longer needs to move massive amounts of data whenever new brokers are added or removed.Storing large amounts of data in Kafka also ends up becoming more than 10x cheaper.Consumer Groups & Read ParallelizationRecall that the log is read sequentially and in order:A topic is split into partitions because it’s Big Data™ - a single node shouldn’t be able to consume the whole topic. You need many consumers to handle the high volume of topic data. is meant to read from a partition at a time. This is done to ensure message order without needing locks.These consumers need to coordinate on how to split partitions between each other.At the same time, Kafka’s goal is to allow  consumption (multiple readers) of  partition(s) for high read-fanout cases.Kafka addresses this through. These groups are a set of consumer client instances (typically on separate nodes) that operate as one coherent unit. They distribute the work among themselves.Each consumer group reads topics independently at its own pace. Consumers within the same group split the partitions between each other.Consumer Groups support dynamic membership - you can scale consumption up or down by adding or removing members at runtime.In essence, read throughput in Kafka can be scaled in two different ways:Add more  to your groupe.g., your topic went from 10 MB/s to 20 MB/s of throughput, and your two existing consumers can’t keep up. Add more so they take up the extra load.e.g., your topic is being consumed, but you’d like a new, separate application type to process the data too. For example, a nightly accounting job wants to catch up with the last day’s worth of payments.The Consumer Group Membership ProtocolConsumers within a group form a distributed processing system. Unsurprisingly, we hit more distributed systems’ problems - how do we coordinate the consumers? They need to:Establish consensus on progress (up to what offset did they read to)Handle liveness (did a consumer go offline, and how do we take over its work)Handle dynamic membership (did a new consumer come online)Distribute work between themselves (which consumer will take which partition)Kafka consumers within the same group don’t talk to each other. They coordinate indirectly through a Kafka broker. The broker that leads a certain group is called the .Kafka again uses a centralized coordination model - the Group Coordinator makes the decisions. Consumers heartbeat to the coordinator and, through a pull-based model, inform themselves of what work they should do.The __consumer_offsets TopicThe Group Coordinator also acts as the “database” which stores the progress of each consumer.Consumer Groups store a simple mapping of ` in a special Kafka topic called . This helps them save the progress on what record they have When a consumer reads messages, it commits the offset up to which it has processed the log via the coordinator broker. This regular checkpointing allows for smooth failovers. In the event of failure, the consumer can restart and resume from where it ended, or another consumer can come and pick the work back up.The special offsets topic has many partitions spread throughout brokers. Each group is associated with a particular partition. The leader of the particular partition that the group is associated with acts as the Group Coordinator for that group. In that sense, every broker in the cluster can act as a coordinator for some consumer group. This prevents hot spots where one broker handles all the consumer groups in the cluster.The consumer group protocol is a critical part of Kafka.It is generic enough to support other use cases beyond consumer groups. It therefore provides a way for external distributed systems to establish leader election and durably persist state through Kafka.Keep this in mind: the next three systems we’ll discuss depend on the group protocol to work as distributed systems.But first, a little about transactions:Transactions & Exactly Once ProcessingI will try to keep this brief because it can get pretty complicated - Kafka supports . But they aren’t quite like database transactions - it’s more about message visibility control.A transaction in Kafka means that:A producer can send many messages. Those messages can go to different topics or partitions. They can also reach various brokers.Those messages will  either be committed or aborted across all brokers.Technically, this happens In other words, the messages are still written to the topics, but consumers can be configured to skip non-committed ones. This is client-side filtering at work.Marking transactions as committed or aborted is achieved through a two-phase commit protocol. It again relies on a centralized coordination model. A Transaction Coordinator broker makes this work. It’s pretty complex.The important thing with transactions is that they enable message deduplication in common cases.: if the network drops the broker response packets, or the broker restarts, the same producer client will idempotently write its message without creating duplicates.: if the producer itself restarts from a clean state, it will fetch its monotonically increasing ID and bump an epoch. This way, a potentially old zombie instance with the old epoch can’t interfere with the transaction.This doesn’t remove all cases of duplicates. Edge cases from external systems can still exist.However, when reads and writes only involve Kafka (and no other external system), exactly once processing is possible.💡This is actively supported and used in Kafka Streams, as we will cover shortly 👇: the brokers, controllers, and coordinators (back-end).: the Kafka client libraries (producer, consumer).These are two more that we will focus on now:A  is an application that:continuously processes messagesworks performantly and at scaleemits the results in real-timesupports complex stateful operations like windowed aggregations and joins of multiple streams of data is a high-level client-side stream processing Java library for Kafka. It offers rich higher-level stream processing APIs that basically do this:continuously read a stream of messages from a set of Kafka input topicsperform processing on these messages (map, filter, joins, sums, stateful window aggregations, etc.)continuously write the results into an output topicHere is a simple pseudocode example of its declarative API:This code continuously counts the sum of human page views over the last minute and produces it in a new topic. Here is an example of what the Kafka topics would look like:This API is intended to be used within your own Java applications. It works like the consumer. It helps you scale by spreading the stream processing work over multiple applications (just like consumer groups do). One difference is that it also lets you spread the work through . It uses the same consumer group protocol underneath to coordinate work between instances.It is technically possible to achieve this with your own code using the simple producer/consumer libraries, but it’d be a lot of work. Kafka Streams is a higher-level abstraction above both clients with a ton of extra processing, orchestration, and stateful logic on top. 👌Kafka Streams only works with Kafka. It takes input from a Kafka topic and sends output to another Kafka topic. This setup allows Kafka Streams to guarantee exactly once processing by using Kafka Transactions. Practically speaking, this means that it can  process data.For example, it could read a set of payment messages in a Kafka topic, calculate the sum, and persist the result in another Kafka topic, with a 100% guarantee that no message was lost or double-counted in the process.If interested in more, here is a quick introduction to Kafka Streams.Kafka does not support types (e.g., int64) nor schemas. Messages are just raw bytes. To process a message, like summing order payment values, you need to be able to parse the message structure and the exact value field. How is this achieved, then?There’s no “official” way, because the open source Apache project does not support schemas. There is a common convention, though. That is to use an external HTTP service with a database that stores the schemas.In practice, a Kafka topic acts as this database. It stores a simple pair of . Kafka clients connect to the service, download the schema, and use it whenever they serialize/deserialize messages.The first such registry was a source-available project by Confluent called Schema Registry. However, without official Apache support or a truly open-source license, the ecosystem has fragmented. There are many different service implementations today. Many Kafka users also opt to manage schemas in their own unconventional ways.The way the end-to-end path conventionally works with schemas:Producers decide on a schema, associate it with a topic, and register it in the registryProducers then serialize the message in the correct structure (including the unique schema ID in the message) and write it to KafkaConsumers download the message, parse the schema ID, then fetch (and cache) the schema from the registryConsumers use the schema to deserialize the messageKafka was created to solve LinkedIn’s data integration problem. It is meant to move data between different systems. This can be difficult because each system can have its own API, its own protocol (TCP, HTTP, JDBC, etc.), its own format (XML, JSON, Protobuf, Avro), and different compatibility guarantees.Kafka Connect helps standardize this. Connect is both a framework (set of APIs) and a  for plugins that connect Kafka with external systems.For the end user, it’s a no-code/low-code framework to plumb popular systems to Kafka and back (think ElasticSearch, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, BigQuery).This ensures a single, standardized way to integrate systems together. The tricky bits of code that guarantee fault-tolerance, ordering, and exactly-once processing are written once (in the form of plugins) and battle-tested.Connect has three main terms one should know about:: the simple nodes that form a distributed Connect Cluster: a worker that acts as the manager of the cluster. It exposes a REST API with which users can check the status of tasks, start new ones, etc: the plugins (or libraries) that run on the workers. They contain the code needed to integrate with other systemsA  Connector reads data from an external system and writes it to Kafka (System->Kafka)A  Connector reads data from Kafka and writes it to an external system (Kafka->System)The end user spins up a cluster with several Worker nodes. They install the particular Connector plugin jars on these nodes. Then, they start the integration with a simple HTTP POST request.This again forms another distributed processing system. The Herder leader election, general cluster membership, and the distribution of new tasks throughout the group of Workers are all done transparently via Kafka’s Consumer Group protocol.Essentially, Connect is a lot of plugin-specific integration logic on top of the regular KafkaProducer and KafkaConsumer APIs. Hundreds of Connector plugins exist, which give Kafka its incredibly rich integration capabilities.With that, we’ve gone over all the important internals of Apache Kafka. I repeat the introductory sentence, which you can now hopefully understand much better:💡 Kafka is an open-source, distributed, durable, very scalable, fault-tolerant pub/sub messaging system with rich integration and stream processing capabilities.It achieves this through many internal details, including but not limited to:The Producer & Consumer libraries & APIsTopics, Partitions, and ReplicasBrokers and KRaft Controller QuorumsIdempotency, Transactions, and Exactly-Once ProcessingConsumer Groups & the Consumer Group ProtocolThis is why Kafka is the Swiss army knife of data engineering.It is a very active open-source project that is constantly evolving. A few notable features that are currently being worked on are:Queues: the ability to read a partition with queue-like semantics. Queues have no ordering but allow for multiple consumers to read from the same log with per-record acknowledgement. This is different from Kafka’s exclusive one-consumer-per-partition model. In that model, consumers read data in order and only know “I’ve read  this message”.Diskless Topics: the ability to host topic partitions in a leaderless way. This happens by leveraging object storage (S3) as the data layer instead of brokers’ disks. This feature can cut cloud costs by + (!), further boost scalability, and simplify managing Kafka.Many alternative proprietary systems compete with Apache Kafka. The one common denominator is that they all use the same Kafka protocol and API. They just implement it differently. These include, but are not limited to, Confluent Kora, AWS MSK, RedPanda, WarpStream, BufStream, Aiven Inkless, AutoMQ, and more.The space is incredibly rich and rapidly evolving.

Sacred Planet with Gulnaz Khan
A four-hour series presented by environmental journalist, Gulnaz Khan. Truly cinematic in its approach, the series was filmed in Africa (Mauritania, Senegal and Ethiopia), Japan, Colombia and Peru, and is a deeply personal and often troubling examination of how climate change is impacting some of the most hallowed places on the planet. At the same time, it’s also a powerful account of how faith leaders worldwide are seeking to mitigate the worst consequences of the climate crisis by drawing on indigenous knowledge, practices and beliefs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>L.I.S.A.&apos;s Universe Window Discoveries are Beyond Expectation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/V8T0oaudXAI</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/V8T0oaudXAI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 21:18:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

Expedited approvals for new cancer drugs have led to massive revenue increases for pharmaceutical companies. However, a large number of these treatments aren't proven to extend the lives of patients very long, if at all. Meanwhile, drugs that do work are sometimes prescribed in far higher volumes than necessary, increasing Big Pharma's bottom line.

If God is perfect, does this mean that God cannot change? Since perfection cannot be improved, would any change diminish God’s perfection? But a changeless God has problems, such as relating to humans in sequence and not progressing. God is more complex than we can imagine, but trying to relate God’s changelessness to God’s perfection probes God’s essence.

Astronomers are captivated by a new cosmic mystery: strange, glowing circles in space that defy all explanation. Known as "Odd Radio Circles", or ORCs, these colossal structures are a million light-years wide and are changing everything we thought we knew about the cosmos. In this video, we’re delving into the leading theories to explain where these giant rings came from.

The companies said the expansion puts them on track to secure the full $500 billion, 10-gigawatt commitment they announced in January by the end of 2025.The five new sites will include three locations developed through an OpenAI and Oracle partnership: Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an unspecified Midwest location. These sites, along with a 600-megawatt expansion near the flagship Stargate site in Abilene, Texas, can deliver over 5.5 gigawatts of capacity, which means the computers on site will be able to draw up to 5.5 billion watts of electricity when running at full load.

For people in countries like India or the Philippines, however, it is already very real. Extreme heat dominates everyday life. Heavy rain washes away houses and roads.

Joan Baking lives with her family in a cemetery in the Philippine capital Manila. Temperatures of more than 30 degrees already prevail there in March. The only way to cool down in the small house is a fan on the ceiling. Joan is pregnant and her body is suffering from heat stress, for which she is taking medication. As a result, her son is born with a severe form of asthma. A disease that worsens in the heat. The family cannot afford hospital treatment. 

In the Indian state of Uttarakhand, people have always lived with the monsoon rains. In August 2022, however, the rainfall was so heavy that a tidal wave swept through the Doon Valley, tearing away everything near the banks. The village of Maldevta was completely buried under rubble and mud. 18-year-old Shivani lost her father. Now she and her siblings have to build a new house - further away from the river -- without the support of their father. They cannot estimate how heavy the next monsoon rains will be. But they have been living in constant fear of new floods ever since the last disaster.

And, like the first game, that time was not wasted.Hades 2 exits early access as a finely-honed and deeply engaging roguelite that builds upon the strong foundations established by the first game. It's larger in every way, with more characters and conversations to enjoy, an entirely new roster of weapons to learn, and deeper customization options to its expanded combat system, yet none of these upgrades compromise Hades' legacy. Rather, Hades 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way, making it a masterfully crafted sequel that is essential to play.Instead of playing as Zagreus again, you play as his sister, Melinoe, who was born after the events of the first game. Your journey with the witchling begins shortly after the titan Chronos usurps the throne and takes over Hades's domain, banishing Hades, Persephone, Zagreus, and the other Chthonic gods as he does so. Melinoe, saved from the unknown fate of her family, has been raised to realize one simple goal: Death to Chronos. That goal is realized over many, many treks through Hades and beyond, with each run featuring randomized elements, including the enemies you'll face and the upgrades you'll earn along the way. With the help of her mentor, fellow titan Hecate, and a cast of new and returning gods, shades, and all those in between, Hades 2 sets out strongly from the get-go with a story that is gripping to watch unfold between runs.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Dayflow – A git log for your day</title><link>https://github.com/JerryZLiu/Dayflow</link><author>jerryliu12</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 14:53:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi HN! I've been building Dayflow, a macOS app that automatically tracks what you're actually working on (not just which apps you have open).- It creates a semantic timeline of your day;- It does it by understanding the content on your screen (with local or cloud VLMs);- This allows you to see exactly where your time went without any manual logging.Traditional time trackers tell you "3 hours in Chrome" which is not very helpful. Dayflow actually understands if you're reading documentation, debugging code, or scrolling HN. Instead of "Chrome: 3 hours", you get "Reviewed PR comments: 45min", "Read HN thread about Rust: 20min", "Debugged auth flow: 1.5hr".I was an early Rewind user but rarely used the retrieval feature. I built Dayflow because I saw other interesting uses for screen data. I find that it helps me stay on track while working - I check it every few hours and make sure I’m spending my time the way I intended - if I’m not, I try to course correct.Here’s what you need to know about privacy:- Run 100% locally using qwen2.5-vl-3b (~4GB model)- No cloud uploads, no account- Optional: BYO Gemini API key for better quality (stored in Keychain, with free-tier workaround to prevent training on your data)The tech stack is pretty simple, SwiftUI with a local sqlite DB. Uses native macOS apis for efficient screen captures. Since most people who run LLMs locally already have their tool of choice (Ollama, LLMStudio, etc.), I decided to not embed an LLM into Dayflow.By far the biggest challenge was adapting from SOTA vision models like Gemini 2.5 Pro to small, local models. My constraints were that it had to take up <4GB of ram and have vision capabilities. I had to do a lot of evals to figure out that Qwen2.5VL-3B was the best balance of size and quality, but there was still a sizable tradeoff in quality that I had to accept. I also got creative with sampling rates and prompt chunking to deal with the 100x smaller context window. Processing a 15 minute segment takes ~32 local LLM calls vs 2 Gemini calls!Here’s what I’m working on next:Distillation: Using Gemini's high-quality outputs as training data to teach a local model the patterns it needs, hopefully closing the quality gap.Custom dashboards where you can track answers to any question like "How long did I spend on HN?" or "Hours until my first deep work session of the dayI'd love to hear your thoughts, especially if you've struggled with productivity tracking or have ideas for what you'd want from a tool like this.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Massive AI Performance Benefit With AMX On Intel Xeon 6 &quot;Granite Rapids&quot;</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-xeon-6-granite-rapids-amx</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 14:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Besides the support for MRDIMM-8800 memory, another distinct advantage of Intel Xeon 6 "Granite Rapids" processors is the continued presence of Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX).

European colonizers worked hard to suppress the Mayan language so much so that the writing system almost completely disappeared. Luckily, there are families like Frank Tzib’s, who still know how to read and write in this unique and complex language. In Mayan written language, each syllable is represented by an image, for example of a face or an animal. The nuances can be difficult to navigate, which is why Frank wants to dedicate his life to teaching Mayan to the children of his village.

[...] ChatGPT-maker OpenAI said on Tuesday it will open three new sites with Oracle in Shackelford County, Texas, Dona Ana County, New Mexico and an undisclosed site in the Midwest. Two more data center sites will be built in Lordstown, Ohio and Milam County, Texas by OpenAI, Japan's SoftBank and a SoftBank affiliate.
 
The new sites, the Oracle-OpenAI site expansion in Abilene, Texas, and the ongoing projects with CoreWeave will bring Stargate's total data center capacity to nearly 7 gigawatts and more than $400 billion in investment over the next three years, OpenAI said. The $500 billion project was intended to generate 10 gigawatts in total data center capacity. "AI can only fulfill its promise if we build the compute to power it," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. The Tuesday's announcement, expected to create 25,000 onsite jobs, follows Nvidia saying on Monday that it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and supply data center chips.

It all came together to create an unforgettable experience. More than nearly any game of its time, I was so rapt in it that I would find my mind frequently wandering back to it, planning new strategies, wondering what would happen next.Tactics is a game that has lived on as a cult classic with sporadic attempts at giving it its due, as with 2007's War of the Lions. The Ivalice Chronicles is the latest and best version so far, modernizing just enough to keep its spirit intact and enhance its memorable story without sacrificing its classic charms.The story primarily follows the life of Ramza Beoulve, the youngest and most obscure member of a storied house of nobles, and his fractious friendship with Delita Heiral, a commoner who was treated like family by the Beoulve clan. As narration informs us before the game begins, history remembers Delita as the conquering hero of the War of the Lions--but it was the relatively unknown Ramza who should actually be celebrated.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hollow Knight: Silksong Review - An Unforgettable Climb</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hollow-knight-silksong-review-an-unforgettable-climb/1900-6418415/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f</link><author>Jordan Ramée</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1587/15875866/4573811-silksong_promo_03.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/reviews/">GameSpot - Game Reviews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hollow Knight is a venture into Hallownest's depths, a methodical descent ever deeper into the quiet stillness of a long-dead kingdom in a desperate attempt to understand why this civilization fell, what possesses only some of its bug citizens to revert into unthinking and violent insects and not others, and what it is we're even doing there. There are no concrete answers to be found or a set path to follow; there's barely a discernible objective for almost the entire game. It is a story built around curiosity, only rewarding snippets of Hallownest's fascinating history to those who venture for no other reason than wanting to do so. It's one of my favorite games of all time, and its sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is even better.In some ways, you can tell that Silksong started out as an expansion to the first game. It plays largely the same, and long-time fans will fall into the familiar rhythm of pogoing off enemy heads and deadly saw blades with downward slashes, frantically healing during brief breaks in an intense boss fight, parrying an attack with a well-timed slash, and breathing a sigh of relief upon reaching the next bench and setting a new spawn point.It's not all exactly the same: Hornet's downward slash is initially her trademark diagonal dive (but you can change it later!), for example. But Silksong like more Hollow Knight. The rhythmic acrobatic nature of combat, rewarding feeling of success from defeating a tough-as-nails boss, and sense of wonder at discovering that there is, in fact, another area to explore are all here. Team Cherry created a superb gameplay loop in the first game, and that fantastic formula continues to shine in Silksong years later.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Solving the Hard Problems • Dave Farley • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMQCiX5wUVU</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TMQCiX5wUVU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 12:01:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph

ABSTRACT
Evolutionary Architecture & Design – Tackling Complexity in Software

Software is a creative act, and is at the forefront of the advance of our culture, we are living through the information revolution. Software is also one of the most complex things that humans build. Sure not all software is cutting edge, but the lessons that we have learned from building cutting edge systems are profound and some of them are widely applicable.

Perhaps the most profound and most generally applicable idea of all is that you don’t build complex systems in one giant bound of intuition and inspiration, complex systems evolve over time and are the product of many many small steps, so how do we, and what does it take to, organise to take advantage of that?

He said that the insufficient fix was meant to patch CVE-2024-10237, a high-severity vulnerability that enabled attackers to reflash firmware that runs while a machine is booting. Binarly discovered a second critical vulnerability that allows the same sort of attack.“Unprecedented persistence”Such vulnerabilities can be exploited to install firmware similar to ILObleed, an implant discovered in 2021 that infected HP Enterprise servers with wiper firmware that permanently destroyed data stored on hard drives. Even after administrators reinstalled the operating system, swapped out hard drives, or took other common disinfection steps, ILObleed would remain intact and reactivate the disk-wiping attack. The exploit the attackers used in that campaign had been patched by HP four years earlier but wasn’t installed in the compromised devices.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Mongol Invasion of Europe</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-mongol-invasion-of-europe</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/68ca9074dc62f0e1d6fa48c9/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=_1HdmME9b465LlUPA9DCbFIenJvJqLw7z1YHD6fHBGQ" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the 13th century, a force unlike any Europe had ever seen came thundering across the steppe.

They expect you to insist on paying—probably three times—before they'll take your money. This dance of refusal and counter-refusal, called taarof, governs countless daily interactions in Persian culture. And AI models are terrible at it.New research released earlier this month titled "We Politely Insist: Your LLM Must Learn the Persian Art of Taarof" shows that mainstream AI language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta fail to absorb these Persian social rituals, correctly navigating taarof situations only 34 to 42 percent of the time. Native Persian speakers, by contrast, get it right 82 percent of the time. This performance gap persists across large language models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Llama 3, DeepSeek V3, and Dorna, a Persian-tuned variant of Llama 3.A study led by Nikta Gohari Sadr of Brock University, along with researchers from Emory University and other institutions, introduces "TAAROFBENCH," the first benchmark for measuring how well AI systems reproduce this intricate cultural practice. The researchers' findings show how recent AI models default to Western-style directness, completely missing the cultural cues that govern everyday interactions for millions of Persian speakers worldwide.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Test If A Multiverse is Safe 💡</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mDAn1nmzEz4</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mDAn1nmzEz4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 22:13:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

Despite the numerous apps now available that offer vibe-coding tools on mobile platforms, none are gaining noticeable downloads, and few are generating any revenue at all. According to an analysis of global app store trends by the app intelligence provider Appfigures, only a small handful of mobile apps offering vibe-coding tools have seen any downloads, let alone generated revenue.
 
The largest of these is Instance: AI App Builder, which has seen only 16,000 downloads and $1,000 in consumer spending. The next largest app, Vibe Studio, has pulled in just 4,000 downloads but has made no money. This situation could still change, of course. The market is young, and vibe-coding apps continue to improve and work out the bugs. New apps in this space are arriving all the time, too. This year, a startup called Vibecode launched with $9.4 million in seed funding from Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian's Seven Seven Six. The company's service allows users to create mobile apps using AI within its own iOS app. Vibecode is so new, Appfigures doesn't yet have data on it. For now, most people who want to toy around with vibe-coding technology are doing so on the desktop.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cluny Abbey: The Lost Holy City Of The Middle Ages</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3exq7Qh4ZQ</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/u3exq7Qh4ZQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:01:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the heart of Burgundy, the small town of Cluny holds a secret.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice explore LISA and the future of gravitational wave astronomy with astrophysicist Kelly Holley-Bockelmann.

Save LISA: https://www.savelisa.org/

How does LISA differ from LIGO? Learn about LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, and how these spacecraft will help us detect gravitational waves from space. Why does it need three spacecraft millions of kilometers apart, linked by laser beams? And how can orbiting cubes of gold and platinum reveal the secrets of colliding black holes?

Kelly explains why supermassive black hole mergers are her favorite cosmic events, how LISA could detect EMRIs–tiny black holes orbiting giants–and why the mission’s three-node triangular design matters. We explore the engineering challenges, from solar storms to relativity itself, and why interferometry is one of the most precise measuring tools ever invented.

The conversation turns to funding, politics, and why U.S. withdrawal could leave China to take the lead. What technologies might spin off from LISA? Could we one day have GPS, but for the entire solar system? And could LISA finally detect primordial black holes or the faint gravitational hum of the Big Bang itself?

Many young people are torn between staying and leaving, resignation and activism. On September 28, they will cast their vote for which path their country will take.

Bordered by EU-member Romania on the west and Ukraine to the north and east, Moldova is Europe’s poorest nation. Jobs are scarce, and especially the young struggle with a lack of prospects. The documentary follows three young Moldovans who respond in very different ways to the challenges their country faces more than 30 years after independence from the Soviet Union.
Ana Popa spent years abroad but made a conscious choice to return home. Determined to make a difference, she organizes protest bike rides and marches, and campaigns to strengthen civil society in Moldava.

Andrei Morari, by contrast, has become resigned towards politics. He grew up in Transnistria, a narrow strip of land between the Dniester River and the Ukrainian border. Transnistria longs for independence and receives support from Russia. The conflict has remained "frozen" since a short military conflict in 1992. The divide between Transnistria and the rest of Moldova runs deep. Andrei refused military service and is therefore barred from going back to his native Transnistria. But he sees no future for himself in the capital, Chișinău, either. Distrustful of all politicians, he won’t be casting his vote at the end of September - instead, he plans to leave the country as soon as he can. 
Veaceslav Sclifos, aka DJ Wenzel, wants to stay. He's passionate about music and dreams of building a techno scene in his small hometown of Criuleni. Everyone in the area knows him as DJ Wenzel. Yet he is also struggling to make a living. His village is on the brink of extinction. Many young people have left, pushed away by the lack of jobs and uncertain futures. 

The documentary captures the dilemmas facing Moldova's youth - as well as their search for creative ways to build a future in their native country.

Released on Steam, Switch, and Playdate (the small yellow handheld famous for its crank controls), it strains the fundamental definition of a video game. Instead, it's more of a simulation of TV channel-surfing in the late '80s or early '90s, a kind of interaction younger generations actually have no experience with. It's a game whose target audience would seem to be very few people at all. And yet, because I enjoy exceptionally weird experiences, it delivers.Blippo+ is a collection of live-action skits meant to play like a cable television package from 30ish years ago. When you first start up the game, it "scans" for channels--a process I vaguely recalled interacting with as a kid when Blippo+ reminded me. Then, once its dozen or so channels are found, you simply... watch TV.The TV schedule plays out in real time. These are not on-demand offerings a la Netflix or HBO Max. This is a perpetually cycling programming schedule. If you tune into the news channel, for example, you'll miss what's happening at the same time on the music, family or--yes--even the porn channel. Each program only lasts a few minutes, so it's not as though you're locked in for 30 or more minutes if you want to watch any single program in its entirety. This also makes it easy enough to eventually catch everything, either by channel-surfing routinely like a kid after school in 1996, or by sticking with one channel at a time until it has looped fully, then moving onto the next channel.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Broadcom’s prohibitive VMware prices create a learning “barrier,” IT pro says</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/09/broadcoms-prohibitive-vmware-prices-create-a-learning-barrier-it-pro-says/</link><author>Scharon Harding</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1287663546-1152x648-1758570568.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:52:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When the COVID-19 pandemic forced kids to stay home, educators flocked to VMware, and thousands of school districts adopted virtualization. The technology became a solution for distance learning during the pandemic and after, when events such as bad weather and illness can prevent children from physically attending school.However, the VMware being sold to K–12 schools today differs from the VMware that existed before and during the pandemic. Now a Broadcom business, the platform features higher prices and a business strategy that favors big spenders. This has created unique problems for educational IT departments juggling restrictive budgets and multiple technology vendors with children's needs.Curriculum impacted by IT delaysArs Technica recently spoke with an IT director at a public school district in Indiana. The director requested anonymity for themself and the district out of concern about potential blowback. The director confirmed that the district has five schools and about 3,000 students. The district started using VMware’s vSAN, a software-defined storage offering, and the vSphere virtualization platform in 2019. The Indiana school system bought the VMware offerings through a package that combined them with VxRail, which is hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) hardware that Dell jointly engineered with VMware.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The myth of Dionysus’ drunken revenge - Iseult Gillespie</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEuvaondSo</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zpEuvaondSo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:00:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dig into the Greek myth of Dionysus, the god of winemaking and excess, and his journey to his ancestral home in Thebes.

--

Acoetes of Maeonia had been roped into serving as the navigator for a band of pirates. And now the pirates had kidnapped a sleeping youth. As they laid their victim’s body on the ship, Acoetes felt the pit in his stomach deepen. The pirates hadn’t noticed, but their new captive was a slumbering god. Iseult Gillespie digs into the Greek myth of Dionysus and his return to Thebes.

Lesson by Iseult Gillespie, directed by Keegan Thornhill.

In the third installment of our six-interview series, hear what Nobel Laureate Roger Penrose thinks about cosmology and his radical view of how our universe began.

Throughout his career, Penrose has challenged conventional wisdom in physics, mathematics, and the philosophy of science. He has tackled some of the most profound questions of the universe: How do quantum mechanics and cosmology shape our understanding of reality? Can human consciousness be fully explained by physical laws, or does it transcend computation? This wide-ranging conversation spans Penrose’s most influential ideas, from black holes and the Big Bang to Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, quantum gravity, and the role of mathematics in uncovering ultimate reality.

Sir Roger Penrose is an English mathematician, mathematical physicist, philosopher of science, and Nobel Laureate in Physics. He is Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford, an emeritus fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, and an honorary fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, and University College London. Penrose has contributed significantly to the mathematical physics of general relativity and cosmology.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pregnancy is Insane</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zpq1GbPqhy4</link><author>Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zpq1GbPqhy4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 14:00:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q">Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get 20% off your first Panda Crate at https://kiwico.com/kurz

Pregnancy is not gentle. Babies begin as invaders, growing a brand-new organ inside another human. For months, they sap energy, hack the immune system, and fight for survival. Out of this struggle emerges the most magical thing there is: new life. 
This is the brutal and beautiful story of how you and all of us came to be.

Long before the rise of the great whites and hammerheads we know today, sharks and their cartilaginous relatives ruled Earth’s oceans and rivers in astonishing variety. It was the golden age of sharks.

But why did sharks get so incredibly diverse and odd during this period, only to lose most of that diversity forever?

DESCRIPTION
Ricky Robinett interviews Ashley Peacock, author of "Serverless Apps on Cloudflare", about the developer platform side of Cloudflare. Ashley explains how Cloudflare has evolved from primarily a security company to a full-fledged developer platform with global deployment capabilities, databases, caching solutions, and AI tools.

They discuss the unique aspects of Cloudflare's architecture, including global deployment by default, bindings that simplify resource connections without requiring secrets management, and excellent local development experience.

Ashley highlights several Cloudflare products including Workers (serverless functions), D1 (SQLite database), KV (key-value store), R2 (object storage), Durable Objects, and AI offerings like Workers AI and AI Gateway. The conversation covers developer experience, using AI assistants for coding, and the benefits of Cloudflare's approach to simplifying cloud development.

Hour by hour, Borman reconstructs Anne's final days of freedom, revealing the complex web of political intrigue, personal rivalries, and shifting alliances that ultimately led to her downfall. Was Anne Boleyn guilty of betrayal - or betrayed herself by a king determined to rid himself of a queen who could no longer deliver an heir? From the royal court at Greenwich Palace to the dark corridors of the Tower of London, viewers are taken on a journey through the escalating tension of spring 1536. What really happened in the days before Anne's arrest? Did she conspire with her alleged lovers, or was she the victim of a calculated political coup led by Thomas Cromwell? Featuring original documents, newly uncovered evidence, and visits to key historical locations, this episode investigates the confession that sealed her fate, the men accused alongside her, and the last desperate letter Anne wrote to her husband, King Henry VIII.

This significant milestone introduces a new layer of flexibility for defining and managing resource allocation for your Pods. This flexibility stems from the ability to specify CPU and memory resources for the Pod as a whole. Pod level resources can be combined with the container-level specifications to express the exact resource requirements and limits your application needs.Pod-level specification for resourcesUntil recently, resource specifications that applied to Pods were primarily defined
at the individual container level. While effective, this approach sometimes required
duplicating or meticulously calculating resource needs across multiple containers
within a single Pod. As a beta feature, Kubernetes allows you to specify the CPU,
memory and hugepages resources at the Pod-level. This means you can now define
resource requests and limits for an entire Pod, enabling easier resource sharing
without requiring granular, per-container management of these resources where
it's not needed.Why does Pod-level specification matter?This feature enhances resource management in Kubernetes by offering flexible resource management at both the Pod and container levels.It provides a consolidated approach to resource declaration, reducing the need for
meticulous, per-container management, especially for Pods with multiple
containers.Pod-level resources enable containers within a pod to share unused resoures
amongst themselves, promoting efficient utilization within the pod. For example,
it prevents sidecar containers from becoming performance bottlenecks. Previously,
a sidecar (e.g., a logging agent or service mesh proxy) hitting its individual CPU
limit could be throttled and slow down the entire Pod, even if the main
application container had plenty of spare CPU. With pod-level resources, the
sidecar and the main container can share Pod's resource budget, ensuring smooth
operation during traffic spikes - either the whole Pod is throttled or all
containers work.When both pod-level and container-level resources are specified, pod-level
requests and limits take precedence. This gives you – and cluster administrators -
a powerful way to enforce overall resource boundaries for your Pods.For scheduling, if a pod-level request is explicitly defined, the scheduler uses
that specific value to find a suitable node, insteaf of the aggregated requests of
the individual containers. At runtime, the pod-level limit acts as a hard ceiling
for the combined resource usage of all containers. Crucially, this pod-level limit
is the absolute enforcer; even if the sum of the individual container limits is
higher, the total resource consumption can never exceed the pod-level limit.Pod-level resources are  in influencing the Quality of Service (QoS) class of the Pod.For Pods running on Linux nodes, the Out-Of-Memory (OOM) score adjustment
calculation considers both pod-level and container-level resources requests.Pod-level resources are designed to be compatible with existing Kubernetes functionalities, ensuring a smooth integration into your workflows.How to specify resources for an entire PodUsing feature
gate requires
Kubernetes v1.34 or newer for all cluster components, including the control plane
and every node. This feature gate is in beta and enabled by default in v1.34.You can specify CPU, memory and hugepages resources directly in the Pod spec manifest at the  field for the entire Pod.Here’s an example demonstrating a Pod with both CPU and memory requests and limits
defined at the Pod level:In this example, the  Pod as a whole requests 1 CPU and 100 MiB of memory, and is limited to 1 CPU and 200 MiB of memory. The containers within will operate under these overall Pod-level constraints, as explained in the next section.Interaction with container-level resource requests or limitsWhen both pod-level and container-level resources are specified, pod-level requests and limits take precedence. This means the node allocates resources based on the pod-level specifications.Consider a Pod with two containers where pod-level CPU and memory requests and
limits are defined, and only one container has its own explicit resource
definitions:Pod-Level Limits: The pod-level limits (cpu: "1", memory: "200Mi") establish an absolute boundary for the entire Pod. The sum of resources consumed by all its containers is enforced at this ceiling and cannot be surpassed.Resource Sharing and Bursting: Containers can dynamically borrow any unused capacity, allowing them to burst as needed, so long as the Pod's aggregate usage stays within the overall limit.Pod-Level Requests: The pod-level requests (cpu: "1", memory: "100Mi") serve as the foundational resource guarantee for the entire Pod. This value informs the scheduler's placement decision and represents the minimum resources the Pod can rely on during node-level contention.Container-Level Requests: Container-level requests create a priority system within
the Pod's guaranteed budget. Because main-app-container has an explicit request
(cpu: "0.5", memory: "50Mi"), it is given precedence for its share of resources
under resource pressure over the auxiliary-container, which has no
such explicit claim.First of all, in-place
resize of pod-level
resources is  for Kubernetes v1.34 (or earlier). Attempting to
modify the  resource limits or requests on a running Pod results in an
error: the resize is rejected. The v1.34 implementation of Pod level resources
focuses on allowing initial declaration of an overall resource envelope, that
applies to the . That is distinct from in-place pod resize, which
(despite what the name might suggest) allows you
to make dynamic adjustments to  resource
requests and limits, within a  Pod,
and potentially without a container restart. In-place resizing is also not yet a
stable feature; it graduated to Beta in the v1.33 release.Only CPU, memory, and hugepages resources can be specified at pod-level.Pod-level resources are not supported for Windows pods. If the Pod specification
explicitly targets Windows (e.g., by setting spec.os.name: "windows"), the API
server will reject the Pod during the validation step. If the Pod is not explicitly
marked for Windows but is scheduled to a Windows node (e.g., via a nodeSelector),
the Kubelet on that Windows node will reject the Pod during its admission process.The Topology Manager, Memory Manager and CPU Manager do not
align pods and containers based on pod-level resources as these resource managers
don't currently support pod-level resources.Getting started and providing feedbackReady to explore  feature? You'll need a Kubernetes cluster running version 1.34 or later. Remember to enable the feature gate across your control plane and all nodes.As this feature moves through Beta, your feedback is invaluable. Please report any issues or share your experiences via the standard Kubernetes communication channels:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Python Audio Transcription: Convert Speech to Text Locally</title><link>https://www.pavlinbg.com/posts/python-speech-to-text-guide</link><author>Pavlinbg</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 18:18:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, I faced a dilemma that many researchers, journalists, and content creators know all too well: I had hours of recordings that needed to be transcribed. I had serious privacy concerns about uploading sensitive content to commercial transcription services and their third-party servers.Instead of risking it, I built a Python-based transcription system using OpenAI’s Whisper model. The result? All my audio files were transcribed in under 10 minutes with 96% accuracy—completely free and processed locally on my laptop.In this post, I will show you how you can build a simple script for processing any audio data without recurring costs or privacy compromises.Essential Setup Requirements1. FFmpeg Installation (Critical First Step)FFmpeg handles audio processing and is required for all transcription methods. This is the #1 cause of setup failures.Install FFmpeg FIRST before any Python packages. Most transcription errors stem from missing or misconfigured FFmpeg. Don't skip this step—it will save you hours of debugging later.Add  to your PATH environment variableYou should see version information. If you get “command not found,” FFmpeg isn’t properly installed.2. Python Environment Setup Virtual Environment Benefits Using a virtual environment prevents package conflicts, keeps your system Python clean, and makes your setup reproducible across different machines. It's a best practice that will save you from dependency hell.Whisper is OpenAI’s state-of-the-art speech recognition model, trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual audio. It’s specifically designed for robust, real-world audio transcription and handles various accents, background noise, and audio quality issues remarkably well.Choosing the Right Whisper ModelStart with 'base' model for most use cases. It offers the best balance of speed, accuracy, and resource usage for typical projects. Only upgrade to 'small' or 'medium' if you specifically need higher accuracy and have the computational resources.Quick testing, real-time applicationsGeneral use (recommended)High-quality transcription needsProfessional work, critical accuracyMaximum accuracy, research purposesBasic Whisper ImplementationHere’s a clean, production-ready implementation:Whisper supports most common audio formats out of the box: WAV, MP3, MP4, M4A, FLAC, OGG, and more. No need to convert files beforehand—FFmpeg handles the conversion automatically in the background.Batch Processing Multiple FilesFor processing multiple audio files efficiently:Generate subtitle files for videos:Method 2: Alternative with SpeechRecognition LibraryFor scenarios requiring different recognition engines or more control over audio preprocessing:Google: High accuracy, requires internet connection and has usage limits. Sphinx: Completely offline, lower accuracy but no external dependencies. Choose Google for best results, Sphinx for complete privacy and offline use.Issue 1: FFmpeg Not Found[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specifiedVerify FFmpeg installation: Windows: Ensure FFmpeg is in your PATH environment variableRestart your terminal/command prompt after PATH changesTry reinstalling FFmpeg if the problem persistsIssue 2: Out of Memory Errors CUDA out of memory or system RAM exhaustedFor files longer than 1 hour, use the 'tiny' or 'base' model. For files over 2 hours, consider chunking the audio or processing on a machine with more RAM. GPU acceleration helps with speed but requires more VRAM.Issue 3: Poor Accuracy on Noisy Audio Low accuracy on recordings with background noise or poor qualityBest results come from: 16kHz+ sample rate, minimal background noise, clear speech, and audio levels between -12dB to -6dB. Record in quiet environments when possible. Even small improvements in audio quality dramatically improve transcription accuracy.Specify language for better accuracy:Use higher-quality model:Based on testing with various audio types on a modern laptop:Whisper Model Performance (1-hour audio file):: 1.9 minutes processing, 89% accuracy: 3.8 minutes processing, 94% accuracy: 10 minutes processing, 96% accuracy: 30 minutes processing, 97% accuracy: Use base model maximum for reasonable speeds: Comfortable with small model: Can handle medium/large models without issues: 3-5x speed improvement (requires CUDA setup)Start with 'base' model on CPU for the best balance of speed and accuracy. If accuracy is insufficient for your use case, upgrade to 'small'. Only use GPU acceleration if you're processing large volumes of audio regularly—the setup complexity isn't worth it for occasional use.Create a simple command-line script for easy usage:Local audio transcription with Python and Whisper offers a compelling alternative to commercial services. With a one-time setup, you get unlimited transcription capabilities, complete privacy, and often superior accuracy compared to cloud-based solutions. after initial setup—no per-minute charges—audio never leaves your machine—94-98% depending on model choice and audio quality—typically 4-16x real-time speed—works without internet connection—transcribe as much as you wantWhether you’re a researcher transcribing interviews, a journalist working with sensitive sources, or a content creator processing podcasts, this local solution gives you the control and privacy that cloud services can’t match.The setup might take 30 minutes, but you’ll save hours of time and potentially hundreds of dollars in transcription costs. Plus, you’ll have the peace of mind that comes with keeping your audio data completely under your control.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Here’s how potent Atomic credential stealer is finding its way onto Macs</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/potent-atomic-credential-stealer-can-bypass-gatekeeper/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/malware.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 17:54:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ads prominently displayed on search engines are impersonating a wide range of online services in a bid to infect Macs with a potent credential stealer, security companies have warned.

There are 1,500 cases per year — with most victims killed by a partner or ex-partner.

Christiane Gomes describes the moment when her partner came into the bathroom with a gun and shot her in the face: "Where did all this blood come from?" she thought. "And what about the children?" Despite being seriously injured, she survived. But even after eight operations, she still suffers from facial pain. She's also struggling to make ends meet as she raises her children alone. But there is still hope: A surgeon is treating her free of charge, and she gets support in meeting with other survivors of attempted femicide. Another woman, Carolina Magalhães, was found dead below her apartment building. A court case is ongoing, but her relatives are convinced that Carolina's then-partner killed her. Meanwhile, in Duque de Caxias near Rio de Janeiro, a police patrol is on the move to protect women who are under threat. The team also visits schools to educate young people about machismo in Brazilian culture, which is considered the main cause of femicide. Police officer Neuseli Pereira says that prevention is key to tackling the problem. Because even though violence against women is now punished more severely, the number of femicides continues to rise. A report by Bianca Kopsch.

DESCRIPTION
Matt Welsh, former professor at Harvard University and AI researcher, argues to Julian Wood that we're witnessing the death of classical computer science as language models evolve into general-purpose computers capable of direct problem-solving without human-written code.

He envisions a future where AI eliminates programming barriers, democratizing computing power so anyone can instruct computers through natural language. While acknowledging concerns about job displacement and societal equity, Matt believes this transformation will unleash unprecedented human creativity by putting the full power of computing in everyone's hands, moving beyond the current "programming priesthood" to universal access to computational problem-solving.

Bill McKibben has spent four decades warning us about climate change. Much of what he predicted has come true. And yet, his new book Here Comes the Sun is more hopeful than you might expect. That’s because, for the first time, we have a genuine alternative: Solar and wind energy are now the cheapest, fastest-growing sources of power on Earth. The revolution has already begun.

This week, Sean is joined by McKibben to talk about the peril and promise of this moment. They explore how close we are to catastrophe, why each fraction of a degree of warming matters, and how the fossil fuel industry is fighting a desperate last stand. They also discuss the politics of energy in the age of Trump, why Texas and Utah may hold surprising lessons, and how cheap, abundant power could transform not just the climate fight but democracy itself.

I see its fog-drenched foothills and derelict buildings. I see its dead-end alleys and blank-faced inhabitants. And though it's not the same haunt that ensnared Harry, Heather, James, and the others--the same town that’s siren song broke many a man while simultaneously building one of the most iconic horror game franchises in existence--Silent Hill f's Ebisugaoka is still a place that demands your attention; a place that, once you're there, you never truly leave. Or perhaps more aptly, it never leaves you.The same can be said for Silent Hill f itself. Although the game distances itself from previous entries in the series--most notably by trading in its Lynchian-meets-Boschian ambience and small-town America setting in favor of slow-burning Japanese horror and the humid foothills of Honshu--its overall experience is every bit as memorable as those offered by its predecessors. And yet Silent Hill f is not merely a somewhat-divergent continuation of a beloved series; it's an evolution, offering several gameplay improvements while also paving a new path forward. With its brilliant writing, well-designed and strategic gameplay, engaging combat, and spectacular visuals, Silent Hill f firmly establishes itself as a phenomenal work of psychological horror and among the best entries in the Silent Hill series.Though Silent Hill f's setting is, to be cliche, very nearly a character in itself, at the center of the game's story is Shimizu Hinako, a young high school student who is violently thrust into a disturbing version of her hometown. In the game's opening moments, it's made clear that Hinako's relationships are rife with tension. As a young woman growing up during the late 1960s, much of this tension stems from her resistance towards being a "proper" young woman, much to her parents' dismay. In her journal, she writes that her father is the very definition of a patriarchal husband--demanding, severe, and domineering--while her mother is passive to the point of cowardice. For a long time, Hinako's older sister, Junko, was the only person she could rely on for companionship and protection. This changed, however, once she got married and left home, leaving Hinako alone and drowning in resentment.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why One Computer Science Professor is &apos;Feeling Cranky About AI&apos; in Education</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/09/21/2331240/why-one-computer-science-professor-is-feeling-cranky-about-ai-in-education?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 23:42:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Long-time Slashdot reader theodp writes: Over at the Communications of the ACM, Bard College CS Prof Valerie Barr explains why she's Feeling Cranky About AI and CS Education. Having seen CS education go through a number of we-have-to-teach-this moments over the decades — introductory programming languages, the Web, Data Science, etc. — Barr turns her attention to the next hand-wringing "what will we do" CS education moment with AI. "We're jumping through hoops without stopping first to question the run-away train," Barr writes...

 Barr calls for stepping back from "the industry assertion that the ship has sailed, every student needs to use AI early and often, and there is no future application that isn't going to use AI in some way" and instead thoughtfully "articulate what sort of future problem solvers and software developers we want to graduate from our programs, and determine ways in which the incorporation of AI can help us get there."
 

From the article:

In much discussion about CS education: 

a.) There's little interest in interrogating the downsides of generative AI, such as the environmental impact, the data theft impact, the treatment and exploitation of data workers. 

b.) There's little interest in considering the extent to which, by incorporating generative AI into our teaching, we end up supporting a handful of companies that are burning billions in a vain attempt to each achieve performance that is a scintilla better than everyone else's. 

c.) There's little interest in thinking about what's going to happen when the LLM companies decide that they have plateaued, that there's no more money to burn/spend, and a bunch of them fold—but we've perturbed education to such an extent that our students can no longer function without their AI helpers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Did the Trojan War Really Happen?</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/did-the-trojan-war-really-happen</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/68c2b1f11f1b04aa3242f1cd/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=sve7utDKRrb2gUgJLKx8RjyiMp6jXMcsNaR0sp2XgQE" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Trojan War is one of the great foundational stories of Western literature - a tale of gods and heroes, betrayal and siege, immortalised by Homer in the .

There are important steps we can take today, such as adopting software signatures in some form, making sure to scan for known vulnerabilities regularly, and being ready to update and redeploy software when critical new vulnerabilities are found. More development should be shifted to safer languages that make vulnerabilities and attacks less likely. We also need to find ways to fund open source development to make it less susceptible to takeover by the mere offer of free help. Relatively small investments in OpenSSL and XZ development could have prevented both the Heartbleed vulnerability and the XZ attack. 

Some highlights from the 5,000-word article:


 Make Builds Reproducible. "The Reproducible Builds project aims to raise awareness of reproducible builds generally, as well as building tools to help progress toward complete reproducibility for all Linux software. The Go project recently arranged for Go itself to be completely reproducible given only the source code... A build for a given target produces the same distribution bits whether you build on Linux or Windows or Mac, whether the build host is X86 or ARM, and so on. Strong reproducibility makes it possible for others to easily verify that the binaries posted for download match the source code..."
 Prevent Vulnerabilities. "The most secure software dependencies are the ones not used in the first place: Every dependency adds risk... Another good way to prevent vulnerabilities is to use safer programming languages that remove error-prone language features or make them needed less often..."
 Authenticate Software. ("Cryptographic signatures make it impossible to nefariously alter code between signing and verifying. The only problem left is key distribution...") "The Go checksum database is a real-world example of this approach that protects millions of Go developers. The database holds the SHA256 checksum of every version of every public Go module..."
 Fund Open Source. [Cox first cites the XKCD cartoon "Dependencies," calling it "a disturbingly accurate assessment of the situation..."] "The XZ attack is the clearest possible demonstration that the problem is not fixed. It was enabled as much by underfunding of open source as by any technical detail."
The article also emphasized the importance of finding and fixing vulnerabilities quickly, arguing that software attacks must be made more difficult and expensive. 
"We use source code downloaded from strangers on the Internet in our most critical applications; almost no one is checking the code.... We all have more work to do."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kindness in Flaws</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/z8sUCOBxVdk</link><author>Horses</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/z8sUCOBxVdk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 15:01:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrx2zrPjhGRi9TwszZiLwEg">Horses</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Find the full, uncensored version of this essay and more at: ⁠https://horses.land]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>World&apos;s Most Explosive Liquid</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onr80iOoEXs</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/onr80iOoEXs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 14:13:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Discover the explosive story of Alfred Nobel.

Malicious versions embed a trojanized script (bundle.js) designed to steal developer credentials, exfiltrate secrets, and persist in repositories and endpoints through automated workflows. 
Koi Security created a table of packages identified as compromised, promising it's "continuously updated" (and showing the last compromise detected Tuesday). Nearly all of the compromised packages have a status of "removed from NPM".

Attackers published malicious versions of @ctrl/tinycolor and other npm packages, injecting a large obfuscated script (bundle.js) that executes automatically during installation. This payload repackages and republishes maintainer projects, enabling the malware to spread laterally across related packages without direct developer involvement. As a result, the compromise quickly scaled beyond its initial entry point, impacting not only widely used open-source libraries but also CrowdStrike's npm packages. 
The injected script performs credential harvesting and persistence operations. It runs TruffleHog to scan local filesystems and repositories for secrets, including npm tokens, GitHub credentials, and cloud access keys for AWS, GCP, and Azure. It also writes a hidden GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/shai-hulud-workflow.yml) that exfiltrates secrets during CI/CD runs, ensuring long-term access even after the initial infection. This dual focus on endpoint secret theft and backdoors makes Shai-Hulud one of the most dangerous campaigns ever compared to previous compromises. 
"The malicious code also attempts to leak data on GitHub by making private repositories public," according to a Tuesday blog post from security systems provider Sysdig:
The Sysdig Threat Research Team (TRT) has been monitoring this worm's progress since its discovery. Due to quick response times, the number of new packages being compromised has slowed considerably. No new packages have been seen in several hours at the time... 

Their blog post concludes "Supply chain attacks are increasing in frequency. It is more important than ever to monitor third-party packages for malicious activity." 

Some context from Tom's Hardware:

To be clear: This campaign is distinct from the incident that we covered on Sept. 9, which saw multiple npm packages with billions of weekly downloads compromised in a bid to steal cryptocurrency. The ecosystem is the same — attackers have clearly realized the GitHub-owned npm package registry for the Node.js ecosystem is a valuable target — but whoever's behind the Shai-Hulud campaign is after more than just some Bitcoin.

The C++ standards committee abandoned a detailed proposal to create a rigorously safe subset of the language, according to the proposal's co-author, despite continuing anxiety about memory safety. "The Safety and Security working group voted to prioritize Profiles over Safe C++. Ask the Profiles people for an update. Safe C++ is not being continued," Sean Baxter, author of the cutting-edge Circle C++ compiler, commented in June this year. The topic came up as developers like Simone Bellavia noted the anniversary of the proposal and discovered a decision had been made on Safe C++. 

One year ago, Baxter told The Reg that the project would enable C++ developers to get the memory safety of Rust, but without having to learn a new language. "Safe C++ prevents users from writing unsound code," he said. "This includes compile-time intelligence like borrow checking to prevent use-after-free bugs and initialization analysis for type safety." Safe C++ would enable incremental migration of code, since it only applies to code in the safe context. Existing unsafe code would run as before. 

Even the matter of whether the proposal has been abandoned is not clear-cut. Erich Keane, C++ committee member and co-chair of the C++ Evolution Working Group (EWG), said that Baxter's proposal "got a vote of encouragement where roughly 1/2 (20/45) of the people encouraged Sean's paper, and 30/45 encouraged work on profiles (with 6 neutral)... Sean is completely welcome to continue the effort, and many in the committee would love to see him make further effort on standardizing it." 
In response, Baxter said: "The Rust safety model is unpopular with the committee. Further work on my end won't change that. Profiles won the argument." He added that the language evolution principles adopted by the EWG include the statement that "we should avoid requiring a safe or pure function annotation that has the semantics that a safe or pure function can only call other safe or pure functions." This, he said, is an "irreconcilable design disagreement...."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Syria - The rise and fall of the Assad regime | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjVcpYzcO8</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/USjVcpYzcO8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 16:00:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On 8 December 8 2024, Syria's dictator Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia with his family. The film, which was shot before and after the fall of the regime, shows why the dictatorship collapsed so quickly and what hopes Syrians have today.

Bashar al-Assad came to power in 2000, after the death of his father. Together with his western-influenced wife Asma, the couple seemed to embody a new beginning for the country. But reforms failed to materialize and when the population took to the streets during the Arab Spring, Bashar al-Assad quickly abandoned his progressive rhetoric. Peaceful demonstrations were met with bloody repression and poison gas attacks. Over 500,000 people were killed, more than 100,000 disappeared and at least six million Syrians were forced into exile.

Among them was the activist Bassam Ezzedine. In 2013, he documented the regime's poison gas attack on the Ghouta region. As a result, he had to flee with his family. His sister and her family remained in Syria and were cruelly punished. She was arrested and her children were taken away from her. 

At the time of the first interview, Bassam, like the rest of the world, cannot know that the regime will soon fall and he will be able to return home. As the filming progresses, change comes at a fast pace.

The war waged by Bashar al-Assad against his own people has destroyed the country’s economic infrastructure. A few weeks before the fall of the regime, Syrian journalist Faysal risked his life to secretly film images of everyday life in Syria: starving children searching for food in the garbage, and endless queues outside bakeries. The country had been bled dry after 54 years of Assad rule. After months of preparation, the Syrian rebels launched a new offensive on 27 November 2024. Within 11 days, they ended the dictatorship - without encountering any serious resistance.

The new government promised an inclusive administration for all. But as Marie Forestier, Syria expert at the European Institute for Peace, explains: "The real challenge for the new president is to broaden his base. Because so far he has relied exclusively on loyalists from Idlib, who are very conservative." And even after the overwhelming victory, the new government does not control the entire territory: in the south, the Israeli army has extended its occupation to the Golan Heights, while in the north, the Turks are bombing Kurdish-controlled areas on a massive scale.

Syria is still unstable. However, the hopes and expectations of Syrians following more than 50 years of Assad rule are high.

What might have first seemed an exhilarating and patriotic endeavour would soon turn into a gruelling and gory series of events, through which your loyalty to the crown would be seriously tested…

Rather than a political and social movement devised by the great founding fathers and resulting in the smooth birth of a nation, the American Revolution truly consisted of a hard, bloody and destructive war. A civil conflict that impacted the lives of so many, and would take the lives of thousands of soldiers who fought in it.

But look at the paintings from the period, the history books, broadway musicals and Hollywood depictions of this war, and you’d believe it to have been a chess match won by plucky patriots against out-of-touch, aristocratic generals.

Beneath of all this was the reality, an arduous series of skirmishes, sieges and pitched battles fought between ordinary British regulars and loyalist troops against so-called rebel militias and Washington’s Continental Army. This would also be a war of attrition, a fight against the elements, and a true test of loyalty. 

So what was life actually like for the average redcoat on the ground? In this series, in collaboration with Survive History, I’ll be recruited into the 33rd Regiment of Foot, a proud military unit commanded by Lord Charles Cornwallis that took part in almost all major campaigns of the American War of Independence. 

Using meticulous research and real soldiers’ diaries, I’ll discover how ordinary civilians in Britain could find themselves in the deep heartland of America within a matter of months, how they adjusted to the novel tactics used by the rebels, the extreme conditions in the colonies and what the chances were of them making it out alive….

Are Britain’s millionaires really fleeing the country—or is the “exodus” just a statistical mirage?

This video digs into the numbers behind the headlines, from the much-quoted Henley & Partners migration report to the real impact of the UK’s non-dom reforms. We’ll look at what’s actually driving high earners to consider leaving, how tax policy shapes behavior, and why trust in government and value for money matter just as much as the top rate.

Along the way, we’ll separate myth from reality, compare the UK’s approach to countries like Sweden and Switzerland, and ask what history can teach us about taxing globally mobile wealth.

If you want to understand the real story behind the millionaire migration debate—and what it means for Britain’s future—watch now.

Big Cats 24/7
Season Two sees the return of a familiar cast of human and big cat characters. The expert team of cinematographers — Gordon Buchanan, Anna Dimitriadis, Brad Bestelink, Sets Nthomiwa, Rea Schulte to Brinke, Greg Hartman and Tristen Woodward — live and work together from the Natural History Film Unit, Botswana’s remote film camp in the heart of big cat territory. Together, they follow the twists and turns in the lives of key, named big cats, introduced in Season One. Across five vital months, cats — and humans — battle punishing seasonal change, from flood to extreme drought. Over brutal terrain, in searing temperatures and through day and night, the team keeps its cameras rolling 24/7 to capture unparalleled, unseen animal behavior. State-of-the-art thermal cameras, and the latest in drone technology, mean the team can film the cats from the ground, the air and, uniquely, through the night, revealing yet more brand-new insights into their lives.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RFK Jr.’s vaccine panel has been discussing changes to the current vaccine guidance</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rZnZTmmoNxs</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rZnZTmmoNxs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 21:00:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[RFK Jr.’s newly appointed Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made changes to the MMRV vaccine schedule and revised guidance for the Covid-19 vaccine

It was a brutal 82-day slugfest in which the US Army and Marines fought a desperate Japanese force that was willing to die rather than surrender. The fighting was so fierce that it convinced the US high command that an invasion of mainland Japan would be too costly, ultimately leading to the decision to use the atomic bomb. This film uses rare archival footage and expert analysis to tell the story of the battle that changed the course of history.

Researchers from multiple security firms largely agree that Turla was behind breaches of . The group conducts narrowly targeted attacks on high-value targets and keeps a low profile.Gamaredon, meanwhile, is a separate APT known for conducting much wider-scale operations, often targeting organizations in Ukraine. Whereas Turla takes pains to fly under the radar, Gamaredon doesn’t seem to care about being detected and linked to the Russian government. Its malware generally aims to collect as much information from targets as possible over a short period of time. Both Turla and Gamaredon are widely assessed to be units of Russia’s Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the country’s chief security agency and successor of the Soviet Union’s KGB.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Recovery From Volume Expansion Failure (GA)</title><link>https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/19/kubernetes-v1-34-recover-expansion-failure/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://kubernetes.io/">Dev - Kubernetes Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever made a typo when expanding your persistent volumes in Kubernetes? Meant to specify 
but specified ? This seemingly innocuous problem was kinda hard to fix - and took the project almost 5 years to fix.
Automated recovery from storage expansion has been around for a while in beta; however, with the v1.34 release, we have graduated this to
.While it was always possible to recover from failing volume expansions manually, it usually required cluster-admin access and was tedious to do (See aformentioned link for more information).What if you make a mistake and then realize immediately?
With Kubernetes v1.34, you should be able to reduce the requested size of the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and, as long as the expansion to previously requested
size hadn't finished, you can amend the size requested. Kubernetes will
automatically work to correct it. Any quota consumed by failed expansion will be returned to the user and the associated PersistentVolume should be resized to the
latest size you specified.I'll walk through an example of how all of this works.Reducing PVC size to recover from failed expansionImagine that you are running out of disk space for one of your database servers, and you want to expand the PVC from previously
specified  to  - but you make a typo and specify .Now, you may be out of disk space on your disk array or simply ran out of allocated quota on your cloud-provider. But, assume that expansion to  is never going to succeed.In Kubernetes v1.34, you can simply correct your mistake and request a new PVC size,
that is smaller than the mistake, provided it is still larger than the original size
of the actual PersistentVolume.This requires no admin intervention. Even better, any surplus Kubernetes quota that you temporarily consumed will be automatically returned.This fault recovery mechanism does have a caveat: whatever new size you specify for the PVC, it  be still higher than the original size in .
Since Kubernetes doesn't support shrinking your PV objects, you can never go below the size that was originally allocated for your PVC request.Improved error handling and observability of volume expansionImplementing what might look like a relatively minor change also required us to almost
fully redo how volume expansion works under the hood in Kubernetes.
There are new API fields available in PVC objects which you can monitor to observe progress of volume expansion.Improved observability of in-progress expansionYou can query .status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] of a PVC to monitor progress of a volume expansion operation.
For a typical block volume, this should transition between ControllerResizeInProgress,  and  and become nil/empty when volume expansion has finished.If for some reason, volume expansion to requested size is not feasible it should accordingly be in states like - ControllerResizeInfeasible or .You can also observe size towards which Kubernetes is working by watching pvc.status.allocatedResources.Improved error handling and reportingKubernetes should now retry your failed volume expansions at slower rate, it should make fewer requests to both storage system and Kubernetes apiserver.Errors observerd during volume expansion are now reported as condition on PVC objects and should persist unlike events. Kubernetes will now populate  with error keys  or  when volume expansion fails.Fixes long standing bugs in resizing workflowsWorking on this feature through its lifecycle was challenging and it wouldn't have been possible to reach GA
without feedback from @msau42, @jsafrane and @xing-yang.All of the contributors who worked on this also appreciate the input provided by @thockin and @liggitt at various Kubernetes contributor summits.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Rate Limiting Strategies Explained, Simply 🚦</title><link>https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/p/rate-limiting</link><author>Neo Kim</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f50746ad-071e-4b2c-ae7b-4ad67d4e0d79_1280x720.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:20:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/">Dev - System Design Newsletter</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get my system design playbook for FREE on newsletter signup:This post outlines important rate limiting strategies. You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, there was a tiny bank.They had only a few customers.And offered services through a mobile app.Yet some people attempted to log in to customers’ accounts by guessing passwords.So they solved this problem by blocking specific IP addresses using firewall rules.But one day, their app became extremely popular.And it became difficult to block many malicious IP addresses quickly.So they set up .It means slowing down requests instead of blocking them.Yet it doesn’t stop abuse because someone could queue many requests and waste resources.So they installed a rate limiter. means controlling the number of requests a user can make within a time window.For example, their app allows only 5 login attempts an hour by a user. While future attempts of the user get blocked until the time window passes.This technique prevents abuse and server overload.Imagine rate limiting as tickets to a movie theater. A show sells only 50 tickets. Once the tickets are sold, you’ve got to wait for the next showtime to get in.The user sends requests through a rate limiterThe rate limiter tracks requests from a user by their IP address, user ID, or API keyThe extra requests get rejected if the limit exceeds (response status code:)The counter resets after the time window ends is partnering with MiniMax for a free TTS API week.Developers & builders can get:• Free & unlimited access to all MiniMax voices until Sept 22• 20% off MiniMax API for a year if you try it this week• $10 Vapi credit with code VAPIMINIMAX10Explore next-gen TTS with the free API now.There are different strategies to implement a rate limiter. It’s one of the most popular rate limiting strategies.Each user gets a bucket of tokensAnd new tokens get added to the bucket at a fixed rateWhile each request from the user needs 1 token to go throughThe request gets blocked if the bucket is emptyThis strategy is easy to implement and understand. Also it allows spiky traffic. For example, imagine the bucket has 5 tokens and refills at 1 token per hour. A user can make 5 requests in a few seconds, but then they’d have to wait 1 hour to make an extra request.Yet this strategy affects the user experience by making them wait a long time if new tokens get added slowly. While refilling tokens quickly might affect the security.So it’s necessary to control the speed at which tokens get added based on the domain and server capacity.This strategy ensures fair usage of resources by smoothing traffic.Each user gets a bucket with a tiny hole at its bottomIncoming requests are like water poured into the bucketWhile water drips through the hole, which means a request got processedAlso water drips at a constant rate, even without new requests, representing server capacityThe bucket overflows if so much water is poured in quickly, which means rejected requestsYet unused capacity gets lost even without processing requests with this approach.Besides it’ll block requests during a traffic burst. So use this strategy when traffic is predictable, and when it’s okay to block some requests for users during a traffic burst.Ready for the next technique?This strategy works well with predictable traffic.Time gets divided into equal blocks; for example, 1-hour windowsEach block has a request limit: 5 requests per hourRequests get counted within the current blockExtra requests get blocked if the count exceeds the limitThe counter resets to 0 when a new block startsAlthough it’s easy to implement, it allows traffic bursts on window boundaries. For example, a user could double their allowed requests by sending them at the end of one window and the start of the next. Thus overloading the server.So use this strategy when the server can handle occasional traffic bursts.This strategy offers fairness and works better with traffic bursts.Define a rolling time window, for example, a 1-hour windowEach window has a request limit: 5 requests per hourA counter then keeps track of the current and previous windowsThe counter combines the current and previous windows to  the number of requests in the last hourWhile a new request gets blocked if the count exceeds the limitPut simply, it approximates the number of requests within the last hour from the current time.Yet it’s more complex to implement than the fixed window, and the rate limiter count is approximate.So use this strategy to rate limit efficiently in systems with moderate traffic.It’s like the sliding window counter, except it keeps a log of all request timestamps. Thus offering accuracy.A rolling time window gets defined, for example, a 1-hour windowEach window has a request limit: 5 requests per hourOld requests outside the window get removed for each new requestThe remaining requests inside the window get countedA new request gets blocked if the count has already reached the limitThis strategy is precise and fair.Yet it’s memory and CPU-intensive. So use it only when strict precision and fairness are necessary.A rate limiter protects infrastructure from abuse and ensures high availability.Yet it’s necessary to choose the right rate limiting strategy to avoid blocking users unnecessarily. Also users from a building might share the same IP address. So it’s better to rate limit a person using an API key instead of their IP address for accuracy and fairness.The right strategy for rate limiting depends on simplicity and the fairness needs.A banking app needs precision and fairness. So it’s better to use the sliding window log strategy for it.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 171,001+ readers strong, very close to 172k.

Users had to choose between data swamp chaos or a maze of metadata files with catalog servers on top. DuckLake is a new paradigm for managing data on object stores: First, it uses classical SQL data management systems to manage metadata. Second, actual data is stored in Parquet files on pretty arbitrary storage. Third, processing queries is done client-side, or anywhere really. DuckDB is the first system to integrate with DuckLake using an extension with the same name. Conceptually, DuckLake enables central control over truth while decentralizing compute and storage entirely. DuckLake turns data warehouse architecture upside down by departing from the integrated metadata/compute layer towards a fully disconnected operation with only centralized metadata. For the first time, DuckLake allows a “multi-player” experience with DuckDB, where computation stays fully local, but transactional control is centralized.Hannes Mühleisen 🔈 is a creator of the DuckDB database management system and Co-founder and CEO of DuckDB Labs. He is a senior researcher at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam. He is also Professor of Data Engineering at Radboud University Nijmegen.~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~[00:00] Spooky ease in tech[00:29] DuckDB and DuckLake[07:50] Pain vs trust factors[13:12] Prioritizing project features[16:16] Platform growth tension[22:06] Building principles[25:26] OSS vs system reliability[30:27] Creative uses of DuckDB[35:35] Tecton product strategy[52:25] DuckDB future shifts]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Da Vinci Code Hoax: What Really Happened At Renne-Le-Château?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RGw00Nuxvs</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-RGw00Nuxvs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Uncovering the fraud behind the myth that spawned Dan Brown's book "The Da Vinci Code".

DESCRIPTION
Tim Misiak interviews Sy Brand about their book "Building a Debugger". Sy, who has a background in GPU compilers and debuggers, discusses how implementing a debugger offers profound insights into computer systems.

The conversation explores the unexpected complexities of debugging fundamentals like stack unwinding and code stepping. They examine how debugging interfaces have evolved and the challenges posed by backward compatibility and language evolution.

Sy highlights areas for future advancement in debugging, particularly time travel debugging for non-deterministic issues and better tools for debugging optimized code. Throughout the interview, both experts share fascinating technical details that reveal why debugger implementation serves as an excellent path to deeper understanding of operating systems and hardware.

It enables flexible resource requests, going beyond simply allocating  number of devices to support more granular usage scenarios.
With DRA, users can request specific types of devices based on their attributes, define custom configurations tailored to their workloads, and even share the same resource among multiple containers or Pods.In this blog, we focus on the device sharing feature and dive into a new capability introduced in Kubernetes 1.34: ,
which extends DRA to support finer-grained device sharing.Background: device sharing via ResourceClaimsFrom the beginning, DRA introduced the ability for multiple Pods to share a device by referencing the same ResourceClaim.
This design decouples resource allocation from specific hardware, allowing for more dynamic and reusable provisioning of devices.In Kubernetes 1.33, the new support for  allowed resource drivers to advertise slices of a device that are available, rather than exposing the entire device as an all-or-nothing resource.
This enabled Kubernetes to model shareable hardware more accurately.But there was still a missing piece: it didn't yet support scenarios
where the device driver manages fine-grained, dynamic portions of a device resource — like network bandwidth — based on user demand,
or to share those resources independently of ResourceClaims, which are restricted by their spec and namespace.That’s where  for DRA comes in.Benefits of DRA consumable capacity supportHere's a taste of what you get in a cluster with the feature gate enabled.Device sharing across multiple ResourceClaims or DeviceRequestsResource drivers can now support sharing the same device — or even a slice of a device — across multiple ResourceClaims or across multiple DeviceRequests.This means that Pods from different namespaces can simultaneously share the same device,
if permitted and supported by the specific DRA driver.Device resource allocationKubernetes extends the allocation algorithm in the scheduler to support allocating a portion of a device's resources, as defined in the  field.
The scheduler ensures that the total allocated capacity across all consumers never exceeds the device’s total capacity, even when shared across multiple ResourceClaims or DeviceRequests.
This is very similar to the way the scheduler allows Pods and containers to share allocatable resources on Nodes;
in this case, it allows them to share allocatable (consumable) resources on Devices.This feature expands support for scenarios where the device driver is able to manage resources  a device and on a per-process basis — for example,
allocating a specific amount of memory (e.g., 8 GiB) from a virtual GPU,
or setting bandwidth limits on virtual network interfaces allocated to specific Pods. This aims to provide safe and efficient resource sharing.DistinctAttribute constraintThis feature also introduces a new constraint: , which is the complement of the existing  constraint.The primary goal of  is to prevent the same underlying device from being allocated multiple times within a single ResourceClaim, which could happen since we are allocating shares (or subsets) of devices.
This constraint ensures that each allocation refers to a distinct resource, even if they belong to the same device class.It is useful for use cases such as allocating network devices connecting to different subnets to expand coverage or provide redundancy across failure domains.How to use consumable capacity? is introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.34. The feature gate must be enabled in kubelet, kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager.As a DRA driver developerAs a DRA driver developer writing in Golang, you can make a device within a ResourceSlice allocatable to multiple ResourceClaims (or ) by setting  to .Additionally, you can define a policy to restrict how each device's  should be consumed by each  by defining  field in the .
The example below shows how to define a policy that requires a GPU with 40 GiB of memory to allocate at least 5 GiB per request, with each allocation in multiples of 5 GiB.This will be published to the ResourceSlice, as partially shown below:An allocated device with a specified portion of consumed capacity will have a  field set in the allocation status.This  allows the driver to distinguish between different allocations that refer to the same device or same statically-partitioned slice but come from different  requests.
It acts as a unique identifier for each shared slice, enabling the driver to manage and enforce resource limits independently across multiple consumers.As a consumer (or user), the device resource can be requested with a ResourceClaim like this:This configuration ensures that the requested device can provide at least 10GiB of .Notably that  device that has at least 10GiB of memory can be allocated.
If a device that does not support multiple allocations is chosen, the allocation would consume the entire device.
To filter only devices that support multiple allocations, you can define a selector like this:Integration with DRA device statusIn device sharing, general device information is provided through the resource slice.
However, some details are set dynamically after allocation.
These can be conveyed using the  field of a ResourceClaim.
That field is only published in clusters where the DRAResourceClaimDeviceStatus
feature gate is enabled.If you do have  support available, a driver can expose additional device-specific information beyond the .
One particularly useful use case is for virtual networks, where a driver can include the assigned IP address(es) in the status.
This is valuable for both network service operations and troubleshooting. for an example of DRA integration in Kubernetes networking. Try integrating with network resources like , , or smart NICs.Start enabling the  feature gate and experimenting with virtualized or partitionable devices. Specify your workloads with  (for example: fractional bandwidth or memory).Consumable capacity support enhances the device sharing capability of DRA by allowing effective device sharing across namespaces, across claims, and tailored to each Pod’s actual needs.
It also empowers drivers to enforce capacity limits, improves scheduling accuracy, and unlocks new use cases like bandwidth-aware networking and multi-tenant device sharing.Try it out, experiment with consumable resources, and help shape the future of dynamic resource allocation in Kubernetes!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta&apos;s most dystopian product yet...</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOejI6c0CMQ</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GOejI6c0CMQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 17:56:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Try Blacksmith for free to run your GitHub Actions 2x faster - https://www.blacksmith.sh/

It's a game in which you routinely shift into something like X-Men's Wolverine, slashing at the undead with the ferocity of a preying mountain lion and carving them to shreds with what is basically an instant win button. But beyond the feature that informs the game's title, this expansion turned standalone sequel actually leans further into horror and survival than anything in the series, making it the most fun I've had with Dying Light to date.Dying Light: The Beast returns the game's original protagonist, Kyle Crane, to the starring role, moving him to Castor Woods, a brand-new location for the series, and a lush nature reserve decorated with once-gorgeous villages that manage to feel both ornate and rustic at the same time. Like before, the game is an open-world first-person zombie game with a significant emphasis on death-defying parkour and brutal melee combat. But The Beast adds (or returns) a few other wrinkles, too.For one, guns are more prevalent than ever this time, though ammo isn't as common. Using guns feels reliable enough but doesn't fill your Beast Mode meter, so I frequently rejected this quasi-new toy in favor of the series' long-held favorites: baseball bats, machetes, and loose pipes fitted with elemental add-ons that light the zombies on fire, send electric shocks through the hordes, or cause them to bleed out between my crunchy swings to their squishy heads.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How do sinkholes swallow entire houses and cities? - Elise Cutts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyUJNsibkfQ</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vyUJNsibkfQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 15:04:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Explore the science of sinkholes, how they commonly form, and what human activities can also trigger them.

--

It was a rainy December morning in San Francisco when the Earth opened up. The ground suddenly fell away into a 12-meter-deep sinkhole that engulfed a garage, part of a street, and a multi-million-dollar mansion. Sinkholes can seem to strike out of nowhere, but they’re more common than people often think. So, how do they form? Elise Cutts details what’s happening just below your feet.

Lost in the focus on Microsoft was something as, or more, urgent: never-before-revealed details that now invite scrutiny of Ascension’s own security failings.In a letter sent last week to FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said an investigation by his office determined that the hack began in February 2024 with the infection of a contractor's laptop after they downloaded malware from a link returned by Microsoft’s Bing search engine. The attackers then pivoted from the contractor device to Ascension’s most valuable network asset: the Windows Active Directory, a tool administrators use to create and delete user accounts and manage system privileges to them. Obtaining control of the Active Directory is tantamount to obtaining a master key that will open any door in a restricted building.Wyden blasted Microsoft for its continued support of its three-decades-old implementation of the Kerberos authentication protocol that uses an insecure cipher and, as the senator noted, exposes customers to precisely the type of breach Ascension suffered. Although modern versions of Active Directory by default will use a more secure authentication mechanism, it will by default fall back to the weaker one in the event a device on the network—including one that has been infected with malware—sends an authentication request that uses it. That enabled the attackers to perform Kerberoasting, a form of attack that Wyden said the attackers used to pivot from the contractor laptop directly to the crown jewel of Ascension’s network security.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can We Run on Renewables?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ByD__-ECSeI</link><author>Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ByD__-ECSeI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 14:00:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q">Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Can we really power the whole world with renewables?

When Sonic the Hedgehog broke out on the Sega Genesis, I couldn't help but compare it to Mario's platforming to measure the similarities and differences. So I have to admit that it's difficult to approach an arcade kart racer like Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds without Mario Kart in the back of my head--especially since that series just had a new entry this summer. But it's that contrast that really makes CrossWorlds stand out in some positive ways. Whereas Nintendo's latest racer excelled due to its simplicity, CrossWorlds offers a massive wealth of options and customization to help you find and craft your own style. There is a  going on, and it can be a little overwhelming, but ultimately the level of depth rewards experimentation.From the start, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds offers three main offline modes, two of which need little introduction: Grand Prix and Time Trials are your tried-and-true staples, and then there's the more inventive Race Park. More on that in a bit. Grand Prix is where most players will start, with a suite of seven Grand Prix to master. These are listed as three races apiece, but each one also consists of a fourth grand finale race that remixes parts of the three prior tracks.And that's where CrossWorlds gets its unique twist, as well as its name. Seemingly inspired by the Sonic the Hedgehog movies, in which rings act as portals to other planets, the tracks in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds are not just straightforward point-A-to-point-B affairs. Instead you'll regularly cross a threshold through a giant ring and into a new world. The race leader chooses a destination, between one known option or another random selection. You hop into another world to visit for a little while, and then portal your way back to the main track you were in.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Most Strict #ProgrammingLanguage @KevlinHenney Has Ever Used: #occam</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XZPMXPQMAjc</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XZPMXPQMAjc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 12:01:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out the full version on our YouTube channel now! #GOTOcon #KevlinHenney #occam2 #KevlinHenneyScreen #ProgrammingLanguages #TIOBEIndex #RedMonk #FutureProgrammingLanguages #Fortran #Fibonacci #EdsgerDijkstra #Programming​ #CodingLife #Coding #SoftwareDeveloper​ #SoftwareEngineer​ #ViralProgrammingShorts #Viral #ViralShorts #TodayInTech #GOTO

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, a single server was enough to run an entire site.The clients connected to it over the internet.But as the internet grew, traffic to some sites skyrocketed.And it became hard to scale those sites reliably.So they installed more servers and added logic for logging, monitoring, and security.Yet it became difficult to update the app’s code without affecting its reliability.It’s a design pattern. And runs a small service alongside the app to help with tasks such as logging, monitoring, or security.Imagine a motorcycle with a sidecar. The driver steers the vehicle, while the sidecar passenger carries the map, radio, or bag.Similarly, the sidecar pattern decouples the operational features from the app’s logic. is an AI code review tool that runs directly in your terminal. It provides intelligent code analysis, catches issues early, and integrates seamlessly with AI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor CLI, and Gemini to ensure your code is production-ready before it ships.Enables pre-commit reviews of both staged and unstaged changes, creating a multi-layered review process.Fits into existing Git workflows. Review uncommitted changes, staged files, specific commits, or entire branches without disrupting your current development process.Reviews specific files, directories, uncommitted changes, staged changes, or entire commits based on your needs.Supports programming languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, Ruby, Rust, Go, PHP, and more.Offers free AI code reviews with rate limits so developers can experience senior-level reviews at no cost.Flags hallucinations, code smells, security issues, and performance problems.Supports guidelines for other AI generators, AST Grep rules, and path-based instructions.The app runs the core logic and handles requests.Although detached, the sidecar and app share the same storage and networking environment.Sidecar runs alongside the app, handling tasks such as logging, monitoring, and security.They communicate with each other through a local network or shared resources, such as a configuration file or shared memory.The sidecar and app start, stop, and scale together for reliability.Also it’s possible to update or replace the sidecar without affecting the app.There are 2 ways to deploy a sidecar:As a separate container alongside the app.As a separate process on the same server.Yet the way a sidecar gets deployed depends on the use case and infrastructure setup.Here are three popular use cases of the sidecar pattern:The sidecar acts as a traffic manager. It controls incoming and outgoing requests for the app.Imagine the app wants to call another service, for example, the payments API.It sends a request to the sidecar instead of calling the API directly.The sidecar then forwards the request to the correct API.It also automatically retries if the request fails due to a timeout or other error.Besides the sidecar decrypts the incoming traffic before sending it to the app.This avoids the need for retry logic or security logic inside the app itself.It’s also used to add HTTPS support to legacy services.A popular implementation of the sidecar traffic proxy is Envoy. It usually gets deployed as a separate container alongside the app.Log management and monitoring increase the app complexity. A sidecar solves this problem by collecting logs and sending them to a central system.The app writes logs to its local file, standard output, or a stream.Sidecar collects these logs from the app and combines them if needed.It lets the developer view all logs in a single place without changing the app’s code.A popular implementation of the sidecar for logging and monitoring is Fluentd. It’s possible to deploy it as a separate process or container alongside the app.It’s unsafe for an app to store sensitive data, such as passwords or API tokens. A sidecar solves this problem by managing sensitive data for the app.The sidecar gets secrets, such as passwords or certificates, from a secure system.It then provides them to the app at runtime through a file, environment variable, or shared memory.This technique keeps the secrets separate from the app’s code for security.A popular implementation of the sidecar for security management is Vault Agent.Here’s how the sidecar pattern helps with a microservices architecture:Sidecar handles extra tasks, while the microservice contains only business logic. Thus keeping it simple.Each microservice has the same sidecar setup. Thus ensuring consistent logging, monitoring, or security features.A sidecar usually runs outside the app. So it doesn’t matter if one microservice runs java and another runs python. Thus making it language independent.Yet everything comes with a tradeoff, and the sidecar too.It consumes extra CPU, memory, and network capacity.It adds extra latency to each request.It introduces the risk of hidden failures because a functional app may look broken just from a sidecar failure.It increases operational complexity as it’s necessary to configure, monitor, and update the sidecar.It brings synchronization challenges as the app and sidecar should start, stop, and scale together.The sidecar pattern became popular with microservices architecture.Yet a monolithic app can also use it to handle operational tasks for reliability.The sidecar pattern is useful if the app runs in different languages and frameworks. But avoid using it if the app has resource limitations and needs fast communication.

While that guidance was issued ahead of the GPT-5 release, I understand Microsoft's model guidance hasn't changed.
 
Microsoft is also making "significant investments" in training its own AI models. "We're also going to be making significant investments in our own cluster. So today, MAI-1-preview was only trained on 15,000 H100s, a tiny cluster in the grand scheme of things," said Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman, in an employee-only town hall last week.
 
Microsoft is also reportedly planning to use Anthropic's AI models for some features in its Microsoft 365 apps soon. The Information reports that the Microsoft 365 Copilot will be "partly powered by Anthropic models," after Microsoft found that some of these models outperformed OpenAI in Excel and PowerPoint.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter Review - A Glorious Return To The Beginning</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-review-a-glorious-return-to-the-beginning/1900-6418410/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f</link><author>Alan Wen</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/43/434805/4570040-71bc9a51af8ea27464aff7bb2225e871.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/reviews/">GameSpot - Game Reviews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter finally addresses a major dilemma for newcomers considering getting into Falcom's epic industrial fantasy saga. While the Trails series has consisted of different arcs set in different parts of the continent of Zemuria that you could start from, when its overarching storyline and continuity spans titles released over two decades, where better to begin than the very first chapter?Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter successfully remakes the game and brings it in line with the standards of a Trails game in 2025, while preserving its original story. This is not a bloated reimagining--Trails titles have already been well-regarded for having a wealth of text, so it's not like a remake would benefit from more fleshing out--but sticks to all of the original story beats, along with a revised localization that's also closer in style to the Japanese text. There are some new lines too, mostly to fill the silences during exploration, but still not quite the same undertaking of localizing a new script from scratch, which is usually why previous Trails games have taken longer to reach the West.Just like the original, 1st Chapter begins with 11 year-old Estelle waiting for her father Cassius to arrive home, only to find he's brought with him an injured orphaned boy named Joshua who's also her age. Fast-forwarding five years later, he's part of the family and the pair are following in their father's footsteps to become bracers: heroic warriors serving and protecting their communities by exterminating dangerous monsters and helping with odd jobs. But besides going from town to town in the kingdom of Liberl and doing good deeds to increase their bracer rank, Estelle and Joshua become embroiled in one mystery after another, from political corruption to kidnappings, culminating in a vast conspiracy beyond what they could have imagined.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kubernetes v1.34: Pods Report DRA Resource Health</title><link>https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/17/kubernetes-v1-34-pods-report-dra-resource-health/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://kubernetes.io/">Dev - Kubernetes Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The rise of AI/ML and other high-performance workloads has made specialized hardware like GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs a critical component of many Kubernetes clusters. However, as discussed in a previous blog post about navigating failures in Pods with devices, when this hardware fails, it can be difficult to diagnose, leading to significant downtime. With the release of Kubernetes v1.34, we are excited to announce a new alpha feature that brings much-needed visibility into the health of these devices.This work extends the functionality of KEP-4680, which first introduced a mechanism for reporting the health of devices managed by Device Plugins. Now, this capability is being extended to Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA). Controlled by the  feature gate, this enhancement allows DRA drivers to report device health directly into a Pod's  field, providing crucial insights for operators and developers.Why expose device health in Pod status?For stateful applications or long-running jobs, a device failure can be disruptive and costly. By exposing device health in the  field for a Pod, Kubernetes provides a standardized way for users and automation tools to quickly diagnose issues. If a Pod is failing, you can now check its status to see if an unhealthy device is the root cause, saving valuable time that might otherwise be spent debugging application code.This feature introduces a new, optional communication channel between the Kubelet and DRA drivers, built on three core components.A new gRPC health serviceA new gRPC service, , is defined in the  API group. DRA drivers can implement this service to stream device health updates to the Kubelet. The service includes a  server-streaming RPC that sends the health status (, , or ) for the devices it manages.The Kubelet’s  discovers which drivers implement the health service. For each compatible driver, it starts a long-lived  stream to receive health updates. The DRA Manager then consumes these updates and stores them in a persistent  that can survive Kubelet restarts.Populating the Pod statusWhen a device's health changes, the DRA manager identifies all Pods affected by the change and triggers a Pod status update. A new field, , is now part of the  API object. The Kubelet populates this field with the current health of each device allocated to the container.If a Pod is in a  state, you can use kubectl describe pod <pod-name> to inspect its status. If an allocated device has failed, the output will now include the  field, clearly indicating the problem:This explicit status makes it clear that the issue is with the underlying hardware, not the application.Now you can improve the failure detection logic to react on the unhealthy devices associated with the Pod by de-scheduling a Pod.As this is an alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.34, you must take the following steps to use it:Enable the  feature gate on your kube-apiserver and kubelets.Ensure you are using a DRA driver that implements the v1alpha1 DRAResourceHealth gRPC service.If you are developing a DRA driver, make sure to think about device failure detection strategy and ensure that your driver is integrated with this feature. This way, your driver will improve the user experience and simplify debuggability of hardware issues.This is the first step in a broader effort to improve how Kubernetes handles device failures. As we gather feedback on this alpha feature, the community is planning several key enhancements before graduating to Beta:Detailed health messages: To improve the troubleshooting experience, we plan to add a human-readable message field to the gRPC API. This will allow DRA drivers to provide specific context for a health status, such as "GPU temperature exceeds threshold" or "NVLink connection lost".Configurable health timeouts: The timeout for marking a device's health as "Unknown" is currently hardcoded. We plan to make this configurable, likely on a per-driver basis, to better accommodate the different health-reporting characteristics of various hardware.Improved post-mortem troubleshooting: We will address a known limitation where health updates may not be applied to pods that have already terminated. This fix will ensure that the health status of a device at the time of failure is preserved, which is crucial for troubleshooting batch jobs and other "run-to-completion" workloads.This feature was developed as part of KEP-4680, and community feedback is crucial as we work toward graduating it to Beta. We have more improvements of device failure handling in k8s and encourage you to try it out and share your experiences with the SIG Node community!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Assassin&apos;s Creed Shadows: Claws Of Awaji DLC Review - Same Old, Same Old</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-review-same-old-same-old/1900-6418409/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f</link><author>Jordan Ramée</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1587/15875866/4569886-acsh_expansion_keyart_4k_desktop.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:15:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/reviews/">GameSpot - Game Reviews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed has long focused each of its stories on a central theme. Almost every aspect of Odyssey's main campaign and dozens of side quests deal with legacy, for example, while Valhalla's lengthy story largely centers around fate. Assassin's Creed Shadows is far less defined, with protagonists Naoe and Yasuke's journey across 16th-century Japan primarily being about found family, but delving into revenge and honor as well. Thematically, it's been the weakest narrative theme of the larger, more RPG-focused Assassin's Creed games, muddied by the main story's aimless second act.Those same problems persist in Shadows' first major story-driven expansion, Claws of Awaji. And while a few changes to the cat-and-mouse formula of pursuing and eliminating targets do make for a more engaging gameplay loop, the persisting narrative issues leave the ending to the DLC, and Naoe's arc specifically, feeling barebones.Claws of Awaji takes place after the events of Shadows' main story. So if you haven't finished Shadows' campaign and don't want to be spoiled, turn back.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Unbelievable Discovery Zhurong Just Made on Mars</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh3Chax2Sw4</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Fh3Chax2Sw4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:04:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[China’s Zhurong rover has found evidence of ancient oceans on Mars.

Mars might once have had the most beautiful beaches in our solar system. For decades, the idea of ancient Martian oceans has been a theory, but now, a stunning new discovery has changed everything. The Zhurong rover has uncovered the first definitive proof of a long-lost ocean on Mars, complete with waves and tides. This discovery is fundamentally reshaping our understanding of the Red Planet, and could finally guide us to where we might find signs of life beyond Earth.

I learned it the hard way after one of my pull requests at  received 30+ comments.At first, it felt overwhelming. But looking back, it turned out to be one of the most valuable learning experiences of my career.It taught me that writing code isn’t just about passing tests, it’s about writing code that other developers can understand, maintain, and build upon.The good news is that writing clean code is a skill that can be learned by internalizing a few key principles and applying them consistently in your work.In this article, I will share 10 practical clean code tips that I’ve picked up over years from senior engineers and reading books like “Clean Code“. is an AI code review tool that runs directly in your terminal. It provides intelligent code analysis, catches issues early, and integrates seamlessly with AI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor CLI, and Gemini to ensure your code is production-ready before it ships.Enables pre-commit reviews of both staged and unstaged changes, creating a multi-layered review process.Fits into existing Git workflows. Review uncommitted changes, staged files, specific commits, or entire branches without disrupting your current development process.Reviews specific files, directories, uncommitted changes, staged changes, or entire commits based on your needs.Supports programming languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, Ruby, Rust, Go, PHP, and more.Offers free AI code reviews with rate limits so developers can experience senior-level reviews at no cost.Flags hallucinations, code smells, security issues, and performance problems.Supports guidelines for other AI generators, AST Grep rules, and path-based instructions.1. Avoid Magic Numbers and StringsMagic numbers (and strings) are hard-coded values that appear directly in your code without explanation. They make the code cryptic, harder to read, and more error-prone.If another developer (or even future-you) stumbles upon a random  in the code, it’s not immediately clear whether it represents seconds in a day, milliseconds in a minute, or something else entirely.Bad Example (Using Magic Numbers):At first glance, nobody knows what  means. It requires prior knowledge or extra digging.Good Example (Using Named Constants):Now, the meaning is crystal clear. Even someone new to the code can immediately understand that the session expires if more than a day has passed.2. Use Meaningful, Descriptive NamesCode is read far more often than it is written. If variables, methods, or classes have vague names, the reader is forced to pause and decipher what’s happening. This slows everyone down and increases the chances of mistakes.Your names should . A reader should understand  a piece of code does without needing extra comments or mental gymnastics.Bad Example (Vague Names):Here, the class , method , and variables , ,  mean nothing to the reader. What does  do? What are  and  supposed to represent?Good Example (Meaningful Names):Now it’s immediately clear: we are dealing with a , and the method calculates and prints the .Consistency in naming is equally important. If you sometimes call a user’s identifier , elsewhere , and in another place , you’re inviting confusion.Bad Example (Inconsistent Naming):String id = "123";
String userIdentifier = "123";
String uid = "123";Which one is the real user ID? The inconsistency makes the code harder to follow.Good Example (Consistent Naming):Use the same term across your codebase. This helps new developers quickly build a mental model of your system.When naming methods, think about how they’ll be used by the caller.Does  mean "validate"? "Charge payment"? "Ship the product"? It’s too vague.order.chargePayment();
order.shipToCustomer();Now the intent is obvious from the caller’s perspective.3. Favor Early Returns Over Deep NestingDeeply nested  conditions or loops make code harder to read and understand. The more levels of indentation you add, the more cognitive load you place on the reader. It becomes easy to miss edge cases or introduce bugs.Instead, you can  by returning early when conditions are not met. This improves readability, reduces indentation, and makes your code easier to follow.Bad Example (Deep Nesting):This works, but the nested  blocks make it harder to see the main logic.Good Example (Early Returns):Now the method reads like a . Once the conditions are satisfied, the main action () is executed without unnecessary nesting.4. Avoid Long Parameter ListsFunctions with long parameter lists are hard to read, hard to remember, and error-prone. When you see a method call with 6–7 arguments, it’s not obvious which parameter represents what especially if multiple arguments are of the same type.Long parameter lists also make functions difficult to extend or refactor. If you need to pass additional information later, the list keeps growing, further complicating the method signature.Bad Example (Too Many Parameters):Calling this method becomes messy:At a glance, it’s not obvious which argument corresponds to what.Good Example (Group into Object):Calling the method now looks much cleaner:Even Better: Use the Builder PatternWhen the object has many optional fields, a  improves clarity and flexibility.Now the method call is . You can easily see what values are being set without guessing their order.5. Keep Functions Small and FocusedLarge, multi-purpose functions are hard to read, test, and maintain. They often mix unrelated responsibilities, which makes them fragile and changing one part can unintentionally break another.A good rule of thumb is: One function, one responsibility.If you can’t summarize what a function does in a single sentence, it’s probably doing too much.Bad Example (Too Many Responsibilities):This single method is handling validation, calculation, payment, and shipping. If something breaks, debugging will be messy.Good Example (Single Responsibility):Now each function has a clear, focused responsibility: → checks input → computes the cost → handles payment → manages shippingThis not only improves readability but also makes the code easier to test and maintain.By breaking logic into smaller functions, you can reuse them elsewhere. For example,  could be reused in an invoice service without duplicating logic.DRY stands for . Duplicate code is dangerous because:If you find a bug, you have to fix it in  copy.Changes in requirements often lead to inconsistencies if one copy gets updated but others don’t.The codebase grows unnecessarily large and harder to maintain.The goal isn’t to remove all duplication at any cost, but to identify meaningful abstractions and reuse logic where it makes sense.Bad Example (Duplicate Logic):Here, both services have the  duplicated. If you need to update the way totals are calculated (e.g., apply discounts or taxes), you must change it in multiple places.Good Example (Extract Common Logic):Now the logic lives in  (). Any change is made once and applied everywhere.KISS stands for “Keep It Simple, Stupid.” It reminds us that software should be as simple as possible, and no simpler.Overengineering—adding unnecessary complexity, abstractions, or features creates code that is:Harder to read and maintainSlower to adapt when requirements changeMany times, developers try to anticipate future needs by writing overly generic or abstract code. Ironically, this extra complexity often becomes useless because requirements evolve differently than expected.Bad Example (Unnecessary Complexity):This design uses  for something as trivial as addition and subtraction. Unless you’re genuinely dealing with dozens of complex calculation types, this abstraction is overkill.Good Example (Keep It Simple):Much simpler, easier to read, and does the job perfectly without unnecessary layers.8. Prefer Composition Over InheritanceInheritance is one of the pillars of OOP, but when misused, it leads to tight coupling, fragile hierarchies, and code that’s hard to extend or change.With inheritance, a subclass is tightly bound to the implementation details of its parent.Changes in the base class can ripple through all subclasses, causing unexpected breakages.Deep inheritance chains are difficult to understand and maintain.Composition, on the other hand, favors building classes by combining smaller, reusable components. It leads to flexible and loosely coupled designs.Bad Example (Overusing Inheritance):Here,  inherits from  and gets a  method that may not even make sense. This is a design smell caused by forcing everything into an inheritance tree.Good Example (Using Composition):Car car = new Car(new Engine());
car.move(); // Driving with engine...

Bicycle bike = new Bicycle(new Pedal());
bike.move(); // Pedaling forward...Instead of forcing all vehicles into one inheritance tree, we compose behavior using interfaces and delegation. Each class is free to define its own functionality without being constrained by a parent class.When to Use Inheritance vs Composition: there’s a clear  relationship and the base class is stable (e.g., ).: you want to add behaviors flexibly, avoid tight coupling, or support multiple behaviors (e.g., a ).9. Comment Only When NecessaryMany developers either  or . Both are problematic:Too few comments make it hard to understand non-obvious decisions.Too many comments clutter the code and often go out of date, making them misleading.The truth is: good code should explain itself through meaningful names, small functions, and clear structure. Comments should be reserved for explaining  something is done, not  the code is already showing. Bad Example (Redundant Comments):// Create a new user
User user = new User();

// Set the user's name
user.setName("John");

// Save the user to the database
userRepository.save(user);These comments add no value, they just repeat what the code already says. Worse, if the method names change ( → ), the comments may become inconsistent.Good Example (Self-Explanatory Code):User newUser = new User();
newUser.setFullName("John Doe");
userRepository.save(newUser);Here, the code is clear enough that comments are unnecessary.Comment the , Not the Sometimes, though, there  value in comments when explaining intent or non-obvious decisions.// We cache user details to reduce DB load, even if slightly stale data is acceptable.
// Freshness guaranteed by scheduled background refresh every 5 minutes.
UserDetails userDetails = userCache.get(userId);Here the comment explains why caching is acceptable, something that code alone cannot convey.10. Write Good Commit MessagesA commit message is more than just a note for yourself, it’s documentation for your whole team (and your future self). Poor commit messages like  or  provide no context, making it hard to understand the history of a project or why a change was made.Help others (and you) understand the  behind code changes.Make debugging and rollback easier.Improve collaboration, especially in large teams.Guidelines for Good Commit MessagesPretend you’re giving a command:  instead of .This matches how Git itself uses messages (e.g., ).Keep the subject line conciseAim for .Capitalize the first letter, don’t end with a period.Provide context in the body (if needed)The subject is  changed.The body explains  it changed or  it was solved.Wrap lines at ~72 characters for readability in CLI tools.Reference issues or tickets (if applicable)Helps track changes to features, bugs, or requirements.These are vague and unhelpful.Short Commit (Simple Change):Add null check in user validationCommit with Body (Explaining Reason):Refactor payment service to use strategy pattern

Replaced conditional logic with a Strategy pattern to make it easier 
to add new payment providers in the future. This improves extensibility 
and reduces duplication across services.Commit with Issue Reference:Fix incorrect tax calculation in invoice generator (#123)

The tax rate was being applied twice in certain edge cases. Added 
unit tests to cover this scenario.Suppose you refactored this:// Old Code
double total = price + (price * 0.18); // 18% GST hardcoded// New Code
private static final double GST_RATE = 0.18;

double total = price + (price * GST_RATE);Refactor invoice calculation to use GST_RATE constant

Replaced hardcoded tax value with a named constant. This makes 
the code easier to maintain if tax rates change in the future.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release and moved to Beta in the Kubernetes 1.32 release.
The recent release of Kubernetes v1.34 moved that support to a second beta.
The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of
extension APIs for group snapshots.
These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes.
Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims
for snapshotting.
A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and
recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point.This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers.While testing the beta version, we encountered an issue where the  field is not set for individual VolumeSnapshotContents and VolumeSnapshots if CSI driver does not implement the ListSnapshots RPC call.
We evaluated various options here and decided to make this change releasing a new beta for the API.Specifically, a VolumeSnapshotInfo struct is added in v1beta2, it contains information for an individual volume snapshot that is a member of a volume group snapshot.
VolumeSnapshotInfoList, a list of VolumeSnapshotInfo, is added to VolumeGroupSnapshotContentStatus, replacing VolumeSnapshotHandlePairList.
VolumeSnapshotInfoList is a list of snapshot information returned by the CSI driver to identify snapshots on the storage system.
VolumeSnapshotInfoList is populated by the csi-snapshotter sidecar based on the CSI CreateVolumeGroupSnapshotResponse returned by the CSI driver's CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot call.The existing v1beta1 API objects will be converted to the new v1beta2 API objects by a conversion webhook.Depending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes project plans to push the volume
group snapshot implementation to general availability (GA) in a future release.This project, like all of Kubernetes, is the result of hard work by many contributors
from diverse backgrounds working together. On behalf of SIG Storage, I would like to
offer a huge thank you to the contributors who stepped up these last few quarters
to help the project reach beta:For those interested in getting involved with the design and development of CSI or
any part of the Kubernetes Storage system, join the
Kubernetes Storage Special Interest Group (SIG).
We always welcome new contributors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Finland&apos;s President Thinks Europeans Live in &apos;La La Land&apos;</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WGkFI6RyD28</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WGkFI6RyD28?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 18:12:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Francine Lacqua asks Finland’s President Alexander Stubb why he once said Europeans live in “la la land.”

It'll help you learn the fundamentals quickly.(You'll also get a 25% discount when you use the code—SYSTEMS25.)Systems design teaches you how to answer those questions well. It is how you go from “barely making things work” to “making things work at scale”. is an AI code review tool that runs directly in your terminal. It provides intelligent code analysis, catches issues early, and integrates seamlessly with AI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor CLI, and Gemini to ensure your code is production-ready before it ships.Enables pre-commit reviews of both staged and unstaged changes, creating a multi-layered review process.Fits into existing Git workflows. Review uncommitted changes, staged files, specific commits, or entire branches without disrupting your current development process.Reviews specific files, directories, uncommitted changes, staged changes, or entire commits based on your needs.Supports programming languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, Ruby, Rust, Go, PHP, and more.Offers free AI code reviews with rate limits so developers can experience senior-level reviews at no cost.Flags hallucinations, code smells, security issues, and performance problems.Supports guidelines for other AI generators, AST Grep rules, and path-based instructions.Here are all the key concepts that you need to understand systems design and become a better engineer:Scalability is a system’s ability to handle increased load while maintaining acceptable performance.These are two ways to scale systems:: adding more machines/ servers to handle increased load by distributing work across them.: increasing the power of existing machines/ servers by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage to handle increased load.Horizontal scaling means ‘scaling out’ to different servers.Vertical scaling means ‘scaling up’ existing servers.2. Throughput & BandwidthBoth terms are used interchangeably, but they have different meanings.Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can potentially travel through a network within a period.Throughput refers to the amount of data that actually transfers during a specified period.3. Concurrency vs. ParallelismMany engineers confuse these terms, so it’s important to understand their meanings clearly.Parallelism refers to executing multiple tasks simultaneously across different processor cores or machines.Concurrency means executing multiple tasks simultaneously, either by running them in parallel or by rapidly switching between them on the same processor core.Parallelism is a subset of concurrency.4. Consistency, Availability & Partition ToleranceThese three terms are crucial for understanding the trade-offs and limitations when designing distributed systems.: The guarantee that a system of all machines connected in a distributed manner sees the same data at the same time.: The degree to which a system remains operational and responsive to requests.The capability of a distributed system to continue operating despite network failures between the connected machines.These three concepts are related to each other through the CAP theorem.Let’s understand what it is next.The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can guarantee at most two out of these three properties (consistency, availability, and partition tolerance) but never all three simultaneously.This leads to systems that either have:High Consistency and Partition Tolerance (for example, databases such as MongoDB and HBase).High Consistency and Availability (for example, traditional relational databases such as PostgreSQL that run on a single machine).High availability and Partition tolerance (for example, databases such as Cassandra and CouchDB).The CAP theorem is further extended by the PACELC theorem.While the CAP theorem states that with network partitioning, a distributed system must choose between availability and consistency.The PACELC theorem adds to this by stating that, where there is no network partitioning, the distributed system still faces a trade-off between Latency and Consistency.The acronym PACELC stands for Partition (P), Availability (A), Consistency (C), Else (E), Latency (L), Consistency (C).We have not yet discussed what latency is, so let’s talk about it next.In distributed systems, Latency is the time it takes for a request to go through the system and return a response.8. Techniques That Reduce LatencyMultiple techniques are used to decrease latency. Some of them are:: a technique where frequently accessed results are stored in memory in a cache server rather than constantly querying the central database (a slow operation) for results.a techniquewhere data is divided into smaller subsets called shards and distributed across multiple machines/ nodes.In this way, when the system is queried, each query only reaches the nodes that store the relevant shards, which process the request, reducing load and response time. a technique of distributing incoming network requests across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded.There are multiple algorithms for load balancing, and some popular ones are:Sending requests to servers in a fixed cyclical order.Sending requests to the server with the fewest active connections.Sending requests to the server with the fastest response time.: Sending requests to servers in a fixed cyclical order, but proportional to each server's capacity.Next, let’s learn about databases.9. Relational vs. Non-Relational DatabasesThe two main types of databases are:These databases organize data into tables with predefined schemas and use SQL (Structured Query Language) to query them. For example, PostgreSQL and MySQL.These databases do not rely on fixed table schemas and store and query data in flexible ways. For example, MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra.10. Transactions & Their TypesThe next concept that you must know about is a Transaction, which is a logical unit of work that groups one or multiple operations.The two types of transactions in distributed systems are:The acronym ACID stands for:: A transaction either completes entirely or fails, and no partial transactions occur.: A system remains in a valid state before and after each transaction, as per all rules and constraints.: Transactions running in parallel do so as if they’re the only ones executing. No two transactions interfere with each other’s intermediate states.: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently saved and are unaffected by system failures.The acronym BASE stands for:: The system remains operational even when parts of it fail, although some data may be temporarily inaccessible.: Data can be temporarily inconsistent across different parts of the system. These temporary inconsistencies are resolved at a later time.: Given sufficient time, all parts of the system synchronize and eventually converge to a consistent state.Relational/ SQL databases use ACID transactions to maintain strict data integrity and relationships.NoSQL databases use BASE transactions to achieve high scalability and performance by relaxing consistency requirements.BASE transactions help large-scale applications, such as those from Amazon, Google, and Meta, work around the CAP/PACELC trade-offs by prioritizing availability and low latency over strict consistency.These are sets of rules that allow different applications to communicate with each other.Think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant. A client requests the waiter. The waiter (the API) takes the order to the kitchen (the Server), and gets back with the food for the client (the Response).Three types of Web API architectural styles are popular and important to know about:This is the most common architectural style for designing web APIs. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (, , , ), are stateless (so each request contains all the information for the server to process it), and usually return data in JSON format.An older, highly structured API protocol that uses XML for message format. It is popularly used in enterprise environments because of its built-in error handling and security features.: This is a newer API architectural style developed by Facebook (now Meta) that allows clients to request the exact data they need. Unlike REST, where multiple endpoints may be required, GraphQL uses a single endpoint to query for specific data requirements.Now that you understand the basic concepts that are useful in designing systems that work at scale, it’s time to explore how they are applied.Look at the apps you use every day and think about how they might work behind the scenes.How does Substack handle millions of blogs?How does WhatsApp deliver messages instantly worldwide?How does your bank app handle millions of users without crashing?Why doesn’t YouTube buffer when millions watch videos all at once?After understanding the design principles behind these existing systems, start applying these concepts in your own work.Practice redesigning small projects you’ve built before. Talk to other engineers to get their perspectives on how they would handle a problem.Remember, every expert was once a beginner. I am sure that you will design systems that handle millions of users before you know it.👋 I'd like to thank Ashish for writing this newsletter!Don't forget to  at a special 25% discount.

Some killer asteroids were found only days before flyby. If they had struck Earth, the power of thousands of nuclear bombs would have flattened cities and killed millions. 
What if we spotted a 100-meter asteroid just two weeks before collision? Can humanity be saved?

Today we’re excited to announce our 2025 Go Developer Survey. The Go Team uses the results of this annual survey to better understand the needs and concerns of Go developers across the world. Your feedback helps us brainstorm, plan, and prioritize work on Go.You can take the survey here. It will be open through . The survey should take 10 – 20 minutes to complete, and every question is optional.We’ll share aggregated survey results on this blog in early November. This year we’ll also share the raw dataset of survey responses, so that the entire Go community can benefit from this knowledge and conduct your own analyses on the data. Similar to our approach with Go Telemetry, we’re using an opt-in model: the survey will ask for your permission to include your responses in the dataset. If you don’t give us permission, your survey responses will not be shared.Please help us reach as many Go developers as possible! We love it when you share the survey with your colleagues, friends, and online communities. The more voices we hear, the better we can understand the diverse needs of Go developers everywhere.We’re looking forward to hearing your feedback!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vibe Coding Has Turned Senior Devs Into &apos;AI Babysitters&apos;</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/09/15/2056250/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Carla Rover once spent 30 minutes sobbing after having to restart a project she vibe coded. Rover has been in the industry for 15 years, mainly working as a web developer. She's now building a startup, alongside her son, that creates custom machine learning models for marketplaces. She called vibe coding a beautiful, endless cocktail napkin on which one can perpetually sketch ideas. But dealing with AI-generated code that one hopes to use in production can be "worse than babysitting," she said, as these AI models can mess up work in ways that are hard to predict.
 
She had turned to AI coding in a need for speed with her startup, as is the promise of AI tools. "Because I needed to be quick and impressive, I took a shortcut and did not scan those files after the automated review," she said. "When I did do it manually, I found so much wrong. When I used a third-party tool, I found more. And I learned my lesson." She and her son wound up restarting their whole project -- hence the tears. "I handed it off like the copilot was an employee," she said. "It isn't."
 
Rover is like many experienced programmers turning to AI for coding help. But such programmers are also finding themselves acting like AI babysitters -- rewriting and fact-checking the code the AI spits out. A recent report by content delivery platform company Fastly found that at least 95% of the nearly 800 developers it surveyed said they spend extra time fixing AI-generated code, with the load of such verification falling most heavily on the shoulders of senior developers. These experienced coders have discovered issues with AI-generated code ranging from hallucinating package names to deleting important information and security risks. Left unchecked, AI code can leave a product far more buggy than what humans would produce.
 
Working with AI-generated code has become such a problem that it's given rise to a new corporate coding job known as "vibe code cleanup specialist." TechCrunch spoke to experienced coders about their time using AI-generated code about what they see as the future of vibe coding. Thoughts varied, but one thing remained certain: The technology still has a long way to go. "Using a coding co-pilot is kind of like giving a coffee pot to a smart six-year-old and saying, 'Please take this into the dining room and pour coffee for the family,'" Rover said. Can they do it? Possibly. Could they fail? Definitely. And most likely, if they do fail, they aren't going to tell you. "It doesn't make the kid less clever," she continued. "It just means you can't delegate [a task] like that completely."

In 2003, Ghislaine Maxwell compiled a 238-page leather-bound book for Jeffrey Epstein — filled with letters, sketches, poems, and photos from billionaires, politicians, scientists, and celebrities. This book was never meant to be public. But now, thanks to the House Oversight Committee, it’s part of the public record — and it’s worse than anyone expected.

We’ll also explore the deeper questions: Where did Epstein’s money come from? Why hasn’t the government followed the money? And what does this say about the two-tiered justice system in America?

This scandal isn’t just about Epstein. It’s about the system that made him possible.

This week, Sean is joined by historian Fara Dabhoiwala, author of What Is Free Speech? They trace the history of free expression from 18th-century pamphleteers, to John Stuart Mill, to the digital platforms that dominate our lives today. They explore why speech is never just “speech,” how context and power shape who gets heard, the dangers of harmful speech, and the challenges of regulating platforms in a global media environment.

Previously, the node lifecycle controller handled both marking nodes as unhealthy with NoExecute taints and evicting pods from them.
Now, a dedicated taint eviction controller manages the eviction process, while the node lifecycle controller focuses solely on applying taints.
This separation not only improves code organization but also makes it easier to improve taint eviction controller or build custom implementations of the taint based eviction.The feature gate SeparateTaintEvictionController has been promoted to GA in this release.
Users can optionally disable taint-based eviction by setting --controllers=-taint-eviction-controller
in kube-controller-manager.We offer a huge thank you to all the contributors who helped with design,

But I'm glad I made the time for Lego Voyagers, because it's the sort of game that is immediately, obviously special, and culminates in a beautiful final few minutes that made my kids and me care deeply for a simple pair of Lego bricks.Lego Voyagers is a two-player co-op game, so there's no solo mode, nor can you pair up with a bot partner. Played online or--even better--with two players sharing a couch, the game takes only about four hours to go through. But that's time very well spent, I can tell you, after having played it with my daughter and son at different times.Lego Voyagers stars two minuscule Lego bricks. Both nameless, they're each personified only by their single googly-eye sticker, as well as their different colors; one is blue, the other is red. The simple, wordless story is nonetheless affecting. As the pair live out their lives as neighbors and buddies atop a small island built of Lego bricks, a rocket in the distance can be seen taking off, awakening in them a passion for science and space travel. Heading off from home, the pair go on an adventure to explore this passion together.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Erys – A TUI for Jupyter Notebooks</title><link>https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2025/09/15/erys-a-tui-for-jupyter-notebooks/</link><author>Mike</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 12:35:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/">Dev - Python Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever thought to yourself: “Wouldn’t it be nice to run Jupyter Notebooks in my terminal?” Well, you’re in luck. The new Erys project not only makes running Jupyter Notebooks in your terminal a reality, but Erys also lets you create and edit the notebooks in your terminal!Erys is written using the fantastic Textual package. While Textual handles the front-end in much the same way as your browser would normally do, the jupyter-client handles the backend, which executes your code and manages your kernel.Let’s spend a few moments learning more about Erys and taking it for a test drive.The recommended method of installing Erys is to use the uv package manager.  If you have uv installed, you can run the following command in your terminal to install the Erys application:Erys also supports using pipx to install it, if you prefer.Once you have Erys installed, you can run it in your terminal by executing the  command.Using Notebooks in Your TerminalWhen you run Erys, you will see something like the following in your terminal:This is an empty Jupyter Notebook. If you would prefer to open an existing notebook, you would run the following command:You can now run the cells, edit the Notebook and more!Erys is a really neat TUI application that gives you the ability to view, create, and edit Jupyter Notebooks and other text files in your terminal.

Telehealth can help.

Rural health care has been in crisis mode for decades due to a wide range of issues from distance to care to provider shortages and budget shortfalls. Rural residents may have to travel up to twice as far to access a hospital than those in urban areas. Staffing shortages mean that even when they do arrive they’re less likely to find the correct specialist. The American Medical Association reported that about 65 percent of rural areas have a shortage of primary care physicians. The list goes on, and despite multiple grants or special designations designed to help close these gaps, the issues persist. The reality is, rural areas need a range of options to better serve their communities. One that’s working right now is the use of telehealth to supplement care. The trouble is, telehealth is frequently overlooked and underfunded, but if used correctly, proponents say it could be a game changer for rural communities, where about 20 percent of Americans live.

And the eight most popular languages in September's rankings haven't changed since last month:

 1. Python
2. C++
3. C 
4. Java
5. C#
6. JavaScript
7. Visual Basic
8. Go 



But by TIOBE's ranking, Perl is still the #10 most-popular programming in September (dropping from #9 in August). "One year ago Perl was at position 27 and now it suddenly pops up at position 10 again," marvels TIOBE CEO Paul Jansen.
The technical reason why Perl is rated this high is because of its huge number of books on Amazon. It has 4 times more books listed than for instance PHP, or 7 times more books than Rust. The underlying "real" reason for Perl's increase of popularity is unknown to me. The only possibility I can think of is that Perl 5 is now gradually considered to become the real Perl... Perl 6/Raku is at position 129 of the TIOBE index, thus playing no role at all in the programming world. Perl 5 on the other hand is releasing more often recently, thus gaining attention. 
An article at the i-Programmer blog thinks Perl's resurgence could be from its text processing capabilities:

Even in this era of AI, everything is still governed by text formats; text is still the King. XML, JSON calling APIs, YAML, Markdown, Log files..That means that there's still need to process it, transform it, clean it, extract from it. Perl with its first-class-citizen regular expressions, the wealth of text manipulation libraries up on CPAN and its full Unicode support of all the latest standards, was and is still the best. Simply there's no other that can match Perl's text processing capabilities. 
They also cite Perl's backing by the open source community, and its "getting a 'proper' OOP model in the last couple of years... People just don't know what Perl is capable of and instead prefer to be victims of FOMO ephemeral trends, chasing behind the new and shiny." 

Perl creator Larry Wall answered questions from Slashdot's readers in 2016. So I'd be curious from Slashdot's readers about Perl today. (Share your experiences in the comments if you're still using Perl -- or Raku...) 

Perl's drop to #9 means Delphi/Object Pascal rises up one rank, growing from 1.82% in August to 2.26% in September to claim September's #9 spot. "At number 11 and 1.86%, SQL is quite close to entering the top 10 again," notes TechRepublic. (SQL fell to #12 in June, which the site speculated was due to "the increased use of NoSQL databases for AI applications.") 
But TechRepublic adds that the #1 most popular programming language (according to TIOBE) is still Python:

Perl sits at 2.03% in TIOBE's proprietary ranking system in September, up from 0.64% in January. Last year, Perl held the 27th position... Python's unstoppable rise dipped slightly from 26.14% in August to 25.98% in September. Python is still well ahead of every other language on the index.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Soldiers Cleaned Their Rifles in the Trenches</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/A0AMmP8NhCg</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/A0AMmP8NhCg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 23:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Race to the Sun&apos;s Surface | Universe | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeexxN_EYNk</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EeexxN_EYNk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 17:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A never before seen adventure uncovering the mystery of our closest star.

Hamid Siddiqi, who offers to "review, fix your vibe code" on Fiverr, told the 404 Media that "Currently, I work with around 15-20 clients regularly, with additional one-off projects throughout the year. ("Siddiqi said common issues he fixes in vibe coded projects include inconsistent UI/UX design in AI-generated frontends, poorly optimized code that impacts performance, misaligned branding elements, and features that function but feel clunky or unintuitive," as well as work o color schemes, animations, and layouts.) 

And others coders are also pursuing the "vibe coded mess" market:
Swatantra Sohni, who started VibeCodeFixers.com, a site for people with vibe coded projects who need help from experienced developers to fix or finish their projects, says that almost 300 experienced developers have posted their profiles to the site. He said so far VibeCodeFixers.com has only connected between 30-40 vibe code projects with fixers, but that he hasn't done anything to promote the service and at the moment is focused on adding as many software developers to the platform as possible... 

"Most of these vibe coders, either they are product managers or they are sales guys, or they are small business owners, and they think that they can build something," Sohni told me. "So for them it's more for prototyping..." Another big issue Sohni identified is "credit burn," meaning the money vibe coders waste on AI usage fees in the final 10-20 percent stage of developing the app, when adding new features breaks existing features. 
Sohni told me he thinks vibe coding is not going anywhere, but neither are human developers. "I feel like the role [of human developers] would be slightly limited, but we will still need humans to keep this AI on the leash," he said. 

The article also notes that established software development companies like Ulam Labs, now say "we clean up after vibe coding. Literally." 
"Built something fast? Now it's time to make it solid," Ulam Labs pitches on its site," suggesting that for their potential customers "the tech debt is holding you back: no tests, shaky architecture, CI/CD is a dream, and every change feels like defusing a bomb.

Kubernetes clusters. On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers:
 and . In the past, both the kubelet
and CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use
the same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would misbehave without any explicit
error message. This was a source of headaches for many cluster admins. Now, we've
(almost) arrived at the end of that headache.Automated cgroup driver detectionIn v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate
KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI, which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI
implementation which cgroup driver to use. You can read more here.
After many releases of waiting for each CRI implementation to have major versions released
and packaged in major operating systems, this feature has gone GA as of Kubernetes 1.34.0.In addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their
CRI implementation is new enough:containerd: Support was added in v2.0.0CRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0Announcement: Kubernetes is deprecating containerd v1.y supportWhile CRI-O releases versions that match Kubernetes versions, and thus CRI-O
versions without this behavior are no longer supported, containerd maintains its
own release cycle. containerd support for this feature is only in v2.0 and
later, but Kubernetes 1.34 still supports containerd 1.7 and other LTS releases
of containerd.The Kubernetes SIG Node community has formally agreed upon a final support
timeline for containerd v1.y. The last Kubernetes release to offer this support
will be the last released version of v1.35, and support will be dropped in
v1.36.0. To assist administrators in managing this future transition,
a new detection mechanism is available. You are able to monitor
the kubelet_cri_losing_support metric to determine if any nodes in your cluster
are using a containerd version that will soon be outdated. The presence of
this metric with a version label of  will indicate that the node's containerd
runtime is not new enough for the upcoming requirements. Consequently, an
administrator will need to upgrade containerd to v2.0 or a later version before,
or at the same time as, upgrading the kubelet to v1.36.0.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Economics of Building Data Centers, GPU Clouds, Sovereign AI</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/Economics-of-Building-Data-Centers--GPU-Clouds--Sovereign-AI-e383raj</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/108178195/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-8-11%2F407328204-44100-2-9553b71cdff43.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Craig Tavares, COO of Buzz High Performance Compute, shares lessons from building GPU cloud infrastructure worldwide.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.I created the block diagrams in this newsletter withOnce upon a time, there was a two-person startup.Yet they had only a few customers and limited features.So they ran their site using a tiny number of application programming interfaces ().But one day, their site became extremely popular.So they set up a microservices architecture for scalability.Yet they knew little about API security.And sent sensitive data in plain text through the API.Also some of their public APIs often failed because of spiky traffic.Besides it became difficult to keep APIs secure as they added more features.So they researched the best practices to secure APIs. brings real-time, AI-powered code reviews straight into VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. It lets you:Get contextual feedback on every commit, not just at the PR stageCatch bugs, security flaws, and performance issues asyou codeApply AI-driven suggestions instantly to implement code changesDo code reviews in your IDE for free and in your PR for a paid subscriptionAPI Security Best PracticesHere’s what they learned:HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.Think of HTTP as a set of rules for transferring information on the Internet.But it sends data in plaintext without encryption. It means someone on the public network can easily access or change the information. Thus making it insecure. So it’s necessary to have Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) on the API.HTTPS encrypts data before sending it. Imagine  as HTTP running over an extra protocol to keep information secure.The extra protocol is called Transport Layer Security (). Think of TLS as a technique to encrypt data sent between the client and server.The client connects to the API endpointThe server gives a digital certificate to prove its identityThe browser checks the certificate against the trusted certificate authoritiesBoth sides agree on a shared encryption keyThen each request gets encrypted with that keyHere are some best practices:Use the latest version of TLS supported by the platformUse HTTP Strict Transport Security ()HSTS gets sent as an HTTP response header (Strict-Transport-Security). It tells the browser always to use HTTPS for this domain for a specific period. While strong ciphers, such as AES or ChaCha20, ensure the encrypted connection is secure.Anybody on the internet can call a public API.Yet only verified users should access the data. So API authentication is necessary; it verifies a user’s identity before giving them system access.Here are some best practices:Use OAuth and OpenID Connect ()Think of OAuth as a standard protocol for authorizationThe client asks for access to the systemThe authorization server checks the identity and gives them a tokenThe API then checks the token before allowing any actionWhile OIDC is a standard way to handle user authentication on top of OAuthUse multi-factor authentication ()It adds extra steps to the authentication for securityThe client logs in with their username and passwordThe system asks for an MFA code from the authenticator appThe authorization server gives a token only if both checks passThe API then checks the token before allowing any actionKeep the token lifespan shortAnd refresh them often to reduce risk if a token gets stolenReady for the next technique?Authorization decides what an authenticated client may do in a system.Imagine  as permission to enter a building. While  is like the key to enter only specific rooms once inside.Here are some best practices:Use Role-Based Access Control ()Group users by their responsibility or functionGive separate permissions to each roleThen assign users to specific roles so they get access permissionsThe system checks the role permissions before allowing actionsUse clear permission policiesWrite clear rules that explain who can access what and whenReview and update permissions regularly to match the latest responsibilitiesProper access control reduces risk. So always give only the least privilege needed to get the job done.4. Rate Limiting and ThrottlingA popular API might get too many requests at once. And this can overload the server and affect its performance. So it’s necessary to rate limit and throttle requests. means controlling the number of requests a client can make to an API within a time window. It protects the API from abuse.The client sends requests through a rate limiterThe rate limiter tracks requests from a client by its IP address, user ID, or API keyThe extra requests get rejected if the limit exceeds (response status code:)The counter then resets after the time window ends means slowing down requests instead of dropping them. It adds a delay between requests using a queue. Thus preventing server overload.Rate limits and throttling keep an API stable. Yet it has to be configured properly for a good user experience.There’s a risk of some requests being malformed or malicious. So it’s necessary to validate and sanitize requests before processing them. checks the request structure, while  removes unsafe data.Use schema validation to ensure the request has the expected structureSanitize requests using proven libraries and tools to block malicious contentThis prevents malicious scripts, SQL injections, and malformed data. means sending malicious commands to the database via API requests. Think of it like smuggling prohibited items inside a shampoo bottle at airport security.Only safe requests should reach the system. So validate and sanitize public APIs.6. Logging and MonitoringPrevention is better than cure.Because of this, it’s necessary to track API activity for unusual traffic or suspicious behavior. Think of it like having security cameras and alarms for safety.Here are some best practices:Log metadata, such as IP address, timestamp, and headers; but avoid sensitive dataUse dashboards or security information and event management () tools to find anomalies and raise alertsSIEM collects logs from different services and analyzes them to find suspicious activity.Monitoring turns logs into early warnings. So use them to avoid API abuse before it causes damage.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:There is a risk of misconfiguration and security vulnerabilities. So it’s necessary to perform security audits regularly.A security audit means checking the system to find and fix vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. Think of it like hiring a locksmith to test all the doors in the house to ensure they lock properly.Here are some best practices:Fuzz test APIs with unexpected inputs to catch bugs or failuresStress test APIs by overloading them with many calls to check if they stay reliableSecurity audits expose vulnerabilities. So use them to fix issues early.Third-party code may contain hidden vulnerabilities.And a system is only as secure as its weakest part. So it’s necessary to keep libraries and frameworks up to date.Imagine APIs as a city’s traffic control system. If a traffic light fails, accidents might happen.Here are some best practices:Patch security problems earlyRemove unused dependenciesReady for the best technique?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Trump&apos;s Fed War Has to Do With Turkey</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgyygZC9iWk</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bgyygZC9iWk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 08:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s a historic moment for the US Federal Reserve.

However, actual attachment capacities can change during a node's lifecycle for various reasons, such as:Manual or external operations attaching/detaching volumes outside of Kubernetes control.Dynamically attached network interfaces or specialized hardware (GPUs, NICs, etc.) consuming available slots.Multi-driver scenarios, where one CSI driver’s operations affect available capacity reported by another.Static reporting can cause Kubernetes to schedule pods onto nodes that appear to have capacity but don't, leading to pods stuck in a  state.Dynamically adapting CSI volume limitsWith this new feature, Kubernetes enables CSI drivers to dynamically adjust and report node attachment capacities at runtime. This ensures that the scheduler, as well as other components relying on this information, have the most accurate, up-to-date view of node capacity.Kubernetes supports two mechanisms for updating the reported node volume limits: CSI drivers specify an interval to periodically refresh the node's allocatable capacity. An immediate update triggered when a volume attachment fails due to exhausted resources ( error).To use this beta feature, the MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount feature gate must be enabled in these components:Example CSI driver configurationBelow is an example of configuring a CSI driver to enable periodic updates every 60 seconds:apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: CSIDriver
metadata:
name: example.csi.k8s.io
spec:
nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds: 60
This configuration directs kubelet to periodically call the CSI driver's  method every 60 seconds, updating the node’s allocatable volume count. Kubernetes enforces a minimum update interval of 10 seconds to balance accuracy and resource usage.When a volume attachment operation fails due to a  error (gRPC code ), Kubernetes immediately updates the allocatable count instead of waiting for the next periodic update. The Kubelet then marks the affected pods as Failed, enabling their controllers to recreate them. This prevents pods from getting permanently stuck in the  state.To enable this feature in your Kubernetes v1.34 cluster:Enable the feature gate MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount on the  and  components.Update your CSI driver configuration by setting nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds.Monitor and observe improvements in scheduling accuracy and pod placement reliability.This feature is currently in beta and the Kubernetes community welcomes your feedback. Test it, share your experiences, and help guide its evolution to GA stability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2378 - Charlie Sheen</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRj5pxG2JPk</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/sRj5pxG2JPk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 17:01:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Charlie Sheen is an actor best known for his leading roles in films such as "Platoon," "Wall Street," "Major League," and "Rooftop Killer," and television shows including "Spin City" (for which he won a Golden Globe Award) and "Two and a Half Men."

--

While cleaning out your uncle’s attic you find a chest with a sparkling potion. The attached tag declares drinking this liquid will make you immortal. Your body will be frozen at its current age, and these effects would be final and irreversible. The instructions are clear — the only question is, do you drink the potion? Sarah Stroud and Michael Vazquez explore this philosophical debate.

And while these issues are addressed, it may have been an overcorrection as Borderlands 4 is cranked so far in the other direction that the resulting game feels like a strange imitation of the series. The core bread and butter of the franchise--rewarding looting and satisfying shooting--remains the same, delivering hours of solid first-person shooter gameplay. The narrative elements, however, are weaker than ever.Like its predecessors, Borderlands 4 sees you embody one of four playable Vault Hunters, outlaw mercenaries willing to do pretty much whatever, whenever, for money and a chance to uncover one of the many treasure-filled Vaults left behind by a long-dead civilization. Each Vault Hunter possesses unique skill trees and abilities, allowing you to flavor your approach to the game the way you want. Vex the Siren is a summoner who can create ghostly visages of either herself or a fanged beast to attract enemy fire away from her, for example, while Amon the Forgeknight uses advanced tech to create elemental axes, whips, or a shield so he can wade into melee combat.This feels like Borderlands' strongest assortment of Vault Hunters to date. While no past Vault Hunter has been a truly bad choice, this is the first time that each Vault Hunter feels incredibly useful in all aspects of play, whether it's dealing with groups of everyday enemies, cutting away at larger bosses, or aiding allies in co-op while they focus on doing most of the damage. While I played as Vex in my main playthrough, I didn't dislike my time with other Vault Hunters on new save files.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Angular with Jessica Janiuk</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/09/11/angular-with-jessica-janiuk/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=angular-with-jessica-janiuk</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED1828201609.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 09:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Modern web development faces several challenges, particularly when building scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications. As applications grow, managing complex user interfaces, and ensuring efficient data handling and modular code structures, becomes increasingly difficult.Angular is a TypeScript-based web framework developed by Google. It’s component-driven and designed for building single-page applications with a strong emphasis on modular architecture and performance optimization. Angular’s scalability, maintainability, and built-in features like modular architecture, TypeScript support, and robust tooling, have made it popular for enterprise applications.Jessica Janiuk is a Staff Software Engineer at Google where she works on Angular, which just hit version 19 late last year.

Within seconds, your screen fills with content from servers that might be thousands of miles away.Behind this seamless experience is a crucial system: .

CodeRabbit is free for all open-source repo's.On the internet, computers communicate using  such as . You can think of them as phone numbers for servers.Humans, however, are much better at remembering names like . We can’t expect users (or even systems) to memorize a string of random numbers for every service they connect to.This is where the  helps. It acts as a translator between human-readable domain names and machine-friendly IP addresses.You type a URL ()DNS maps it to the correct IP ()Your browser connects to that IPWithout DNS, we would all be forced to type raw IP addresses such as  into our browsers. That would make using the internet far less convenient.When you enter a domain name (e.g., google.com) in your browser, here’s the step-by-step journey of how that name gets resolved into an IP address:The browser’s first checks is its own cache. It checks whether it has recently resolved the domain you’re trying to visit.If so, it uses the cached IP directly. This is the fastest path because no extra work needed.2. The Operating System CacheIf the browser doesn’t know, it turns to your computer’s operating system.The OS maintains its own local cache of recent domain lookups, shared across applications. If the record exists here, the operating system returns the IP and the search is complete.3. The Recursive ResolverIf the OS doesn’t have the answer, your computer sends the query to a special server called a .This resolver is usually operated by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a public DNS service like:The recursive resolver's job is to do all the hard work of hunting down the correct IP address for you. It won’t give up until it finds the answer or confirms the domain does not exist.If the resolver doesn’t already have the answer in its cache, it starts its search at the very top of the internet's hierarchy: the .There are only 13 sets of these root servers globally (though they are replicated in hundreds of locations for reliability).Root servers don’t know the final IP, but they know where to look next.They looks at the last part of the domain (.com in   and direct the resolver to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) server.The resolver now talks to the TLD servers. The  manages all domains ending in a specific extension, like , , , , etc.So, the resolver asks the  TLD server, "Hey, where can I find information about ?"The TLD server doesn't have the final IP address either. However, it knows which server  the official record-keeper for the  domain. It points the resolver to that domain's Authoritative Name Server.6. The Authoritative Name ServerFinally, the resolver contacts the authoritative name server. This server is the ultimate source of truth for a specific domain. It holds the official DNS records for  and knows the exact IP address.Authoritative server responds with the correct IP address (e.g., ).These records can include multiple IPs for load balancing and failover.The authoritative server returns the actual  (for IPv4) or  (for IPv6). It can also return other records depending on the query (e.g., MX for email, CNAME for aliases, TXT for verification).The recursive resolver now has the IP address. It passes this information back to your computer. Your computer then  this answer so it doesn't have to repeat the whole process next time. Finally, your browser uses the IP address to connect to Google's server, and the webpage begins to load.All of this happens in milliseconds.Authoritative name servers don’t just store one type of record. They store different kinds of instructions, each serving a purpose:The magic of DNS is not just in translating names to numbers but in how it does this  for billions of users every day. Several design choices make DNS both fast and resilient:1. Global Anycast NetworksRoot servers and public resolvers (like Cloudflare or Google DNS) use , which means the same IP address is advertised from many locations around the world.When you send a query, it automatically goes to the nearest available server.This reduces latency and ensures your request doesn’t have to travel halfway across the globe.2. Redundant Authoritative ServersDomains usually have more than one authoritative name server, spread across different regions.If one server fails or becomes unreachable, another can respond.This redundancy ensures high availability and fault tolerance.Some domains use geographic-based DNS responses.The same domain may resolve to different IP addresses depending on where the request originates.This can improve performance (by routing you to the closest server) or meet compliance needs (by directing you to a country-specific data center).4. Load Balancing with DNSDNS can return multiple IP addresses for a single domain.With multiple  or , traffic gets distributed across several servers.This simple form of load balancing spreads requests and prevents any single server from being overwhelmed.5. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)Many websites rely on CDNs to speed up content delivery.DNS queries resolve to an  located near the user.This way, static files (like images, videos, scripts) load from the closest location, reducing latency and improving user experience.The next time you type a URL, remember what’s happening behind the scenes:Your browser first checks if it already knows the IP.If not, your computer passes the question along until eventually an authoritative source answers.Thanks to caching and a hierarchy of servers, this whole process is fast, efficient, and mostly invisible to you.DNS is one of those quiet heroes of the internet: always working in the background, making sure humans can use names while machines use numbers.

which introduces additional API calls and complexity,
For example, you need to separately manage the Pods of your workloads
and their configurations, while ensuring orderly
updates for both the configurations and the workload Pods.Alternatively, you might be using a vendor-supplied container
that requires environment variables (such as a license key or a one-time token),
but you don’t want to hard-code them or mount volumes just to get the job done.If that's the situation you are in, you now have a new (alpha) way to
achieve that. Provided you have the feature gate
enabled across your cluster, you can tell the kubelet to load a container's
environment variables from a volume (the volume must be part of the Pod that
the container belongs to).
this feature gate allows you to load environment variables directly from a file in an emptyDir volume
without actually mounting that file into the container.
It’s a simple yet elegant solution to some surprisingly common problems.At its core, this feature allows you to point your container to a file,
one generated by an ,
and have Kubernetes parse that file to set your environment variables.
The file lives in an  volume (a temporary storage space that lasts as long as the pod does),
Your main container doesn’t need to mount the volume.
The kubelet will read the file and inject these variables when the container starts.Using this approach is a breeze.
You define your environment variables in the pod spec using the  field,
which tells Kubernetes where to find the file and which key to pull.
The file itself resembles the standard for .env syntax (think KEY=VALUE),
and (for this alpha stage at least) you must ensure that it is written into
an  volume. Other volume types aren't supported for this feature.
At least one init container must mount that  volume (to write the file),
but the main container doesn’t need to—it just gets the variables handed to it at startup.While this feature supports handling sensitive data such as keys or tokens,
note that its implementation relies on  volumes mounted into pod.
Operators with node filesystem access could therefore
easily retrieve this sensitive data through pod directory paths.If storing sensitive data like keys or tokens using this feature,
ensure your cluster security policies effectively protect nodes
against unauthorized access to prevent exposure of confidential information.This feature will eliminate a number of complex workarounds used today, simplifying
apps authoring, and opening doors for more use cases. Kubernetes stays flexible and
open for feedback. Tell us how you use this feature or what is missing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2377 - Carrot Top</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8mveWHwC4E</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/q8mveWHwC4E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 17:01:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Scott "Carrot Top" Thompson is a trailblazing comedian, television personality, and actor celebrating 16 years of residency at the Las Vegas Luxor Hotel and Casino.

A major focus of this effort has been taming  requests, which have historically been a primary source of high memory usage and heavy load on the  datastore.
With each release, we've chipped away at the problem, and today, we're thrilled to announce the final major piece of this puzzle.The snapshottable API server cache feature has graduated to  in Kubernetes v1.34,
culminating a multi-release effort to allow virtually all read requests to be served directly from the API server's cache.The path to the current state involved several key enhancements over recent releases that paved the way for today's announcement.Consistent reads from cache (Beta in v1.31)While the API server has long used a cache for performance, a key milestone was guaranteeing consistent reads of the latest data from it. This v1.31 enhancement allowed the watch cache to be used for strongly-consistent read requests for the first time, a huge win as it enabled  (e.g. "a list of pods bound to this node") to be safely served from the cache instead of etcd, dramatically reducing its load for common workloads.Taming large responses with streaming (Beta in v1.33)Another key improvement was tackling the problem of memory spikes when transmitting large responses. The streaming encoder, introduced in v1.33, allowed the API server to send list items one by one, rather than buffering the entire multi-gigabyte response in memory. This made the memory cost of sending a response predictable and minimal, regardless of its size.Despite these huge improvements, a critical gap remained. Any request for a historical —most commonly used for paginating through large result sets—still had to bypass the cache and query  directly. This meant that the cost of  the data was still unpredictable and could put significant memory pressure on the API server.The snapshottable API server cache solves this final piece of the puzzle.
This feature enhances the watch cache, enabling it to generate efficient, point-in-time snapshots of its state.Here’s how it works: for each update, the cache creates a lightweight snapshot.
These snapshots are "lazy copies," meaning they don't duplicate objects but simply store pointers, making them incredibly memory-efficient.When a  request for a historical  arrives, the API server now finds the corresponding snapshot and serves the response directly from its memory.
This closes the final major gap, allowing paginated requests to be served entirely from the cache.With this final piece in place, the synergy of these three features ushers in a new era of API server predictability and performance::  and  work together to ensure nearly all read requests—whether for the latest data or a historical snapshot—are served from the API server's memory.:  ensure that sending this data to the client has a minimal and constant memory footprint.The result is a system where the resource cost of read operations is almost fully predictable and much more resiliant to spikes in request load.
This means dramatically reduced memory pressure, a lighter load on , and a more stable, scalable, and reliable control plane for all Kubernetes clusters.With its graduation to Beta, the  feature gate is  in Kubernetes v1.34. There are no actions required to start benefiting from these performance and stability improvements.Special thanks for designing, implementing, and reviewing these critical features go to:...and many others in SIG API Machinery. This milestone is a testament to the community's dedication to building a more scalable and robust Kubernetes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The largest supply-chain attack ever…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVqIx-Y8s-s</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/QVqIx-Y8s-s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 9 Sep 2025 17:06:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get 20% off Mobbin Pro to make your apps not ugly - https://mobbin.com/fireship

With the introduction of open source catalogs like HuggingFace and Ollama, a new standard has been established for locating, identifying, and deploying machine learning and AI models. But with this new standard comes a plethora of security, governance, and legal challenges that organizations need to address before they can comfortably allow developers to freely build and deploy ML/AI applications. In this conversation, we will discuss ways that enterprise-scale organizations are addressing these challenges to safely and securely build these development environments. Hudson Buzby is a solution engineer with an emphasis on MLOps, LLMOps, Big Data, and Distributed Systems, leveraging his expertise to help organizations optimize their machine learning operations and large language model deployments. His role involves providing technical solutions and guidance to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of AI-driven projects.~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~[00:00] Value of Centralized Gateway[00:35] Point Break vs Big Lebowski[01:47] AI adoption failure stats[05:12] ML vs Generative AI[12:04] LLM adoption in enterprise[18:08] MLOps Community alternative[23:43] AI governance challenges[27:39] Organizational debt comparison[35:59] MLOps to platform evolution[40:56] MLOps then vs now[49:48] Model trust and safety[52:19] AI model effectiveness[55:54] Product discovery process]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What are truffles, and why are they so expensive? - Carolyn Beans</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZCTazqNYMo</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/7ZCTazqNYMo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 9 Sep 2025 15:01:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dig into the truffle’s unique and mysterious biology to find out what makes them so rare and the limitations of farming them.

--

Truffles are one of the world’s most expensive foods— in part because global demand often outstrips supply. And truffles are becoming even more rare and more expensive as deforestation and climate change shrink their suitable terrain. But why are these fungi so rare? And why don’t we just farm more of them? Carolyn Beans digs into the truffle’s unique and somewhat mysterious biology.

The Register reports: According to a communication sent to employees, those in General & Administrative areas will join IBM, including the lion's share of the people working in the HR, finance, accounting, and legal units at Red Hat. A source told us the switch will be "implemented this year," although in some countries "it might take longer due to legal constraints." The leadership running those teams will remain within the Red Hat fold. Some are nervous about the move, with tech companies -- notably IBM -- eliminating duplicated roles to consolidate back-office functions. In January -- as has happened in recent years -- IBM again forecast annual savings of $3.5 billion, partly through job cuts.
 
There is no public data on the size of the G&A population within Red Hat but the total workforce is understood to be about 19,000 worldwide, with the bulk of those employed in the engineering, sales, and support divisions. The team remaining at Red Hat will be part of the central Strategy & Operations group managed by Mike Ferris. As such, engineering, product, sales, and marketing personnel will be unaffected. For now at least. "Culture has been dead for at least 1 year now," said Reddit user Purple_Afternoon 966. "The experience might be different depending on the department, but there is nothing left from the open culture praised. We have now micromanagement, decision making from middle management that clearly have no idea of what we do and how and trying to implement ideas that they read somewhere, with no context, data and not giving answer or addressing feedback."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SED News: Perplexity’s Chrome Play, Meta’s AI Freeze, and Intel Becomes Too Big to Fail</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/09/09/sed-news-perplexitys-chrome-play-metas-ai-freeze-and-intel-becomes-too-big-to-fail/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=sed-news-perplexitys-chrome-play-metas-ai-freeze-and-intel-becomes-too-big-to-fail</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED4965864725.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 9 Sep 2025 09:00:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[SED News is a monthly podcast from Software Engineering Daily where hosts Gregor Vand and Sean Falconer unpack the biggest stories shaping software engineering, Silicon Valley, and the broader tech industry.In this episode, they discuss Perplexity’s headline-grabbing offer to buy Google Chrome, the U.S. government’s large stake in Intel, Meta’s abrupt pause on AI hiring, and a reality check on what “agentic” systems can actually deliver today versus the hype.They also dive into standout discussions from Hacker News, including a proposal to curb “ghost job” postings with stricter transparency rules, an interactive Big-O explainer, and more.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A new experimental Go API for JSON</title><link>https://go.dev/blog/jsonv2-exp</link><author>Joe Tsai, Daniel Martí, Johan Brandhorst-Satzkorn, Roger Peppe, Chris Hines, and Damien Neil</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Tue, 9 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://blog.golang.org/feed.atom">Dev - Golang Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
is a simple data interchange format. Almost 15 years ago,
we wrote about support for JSON in Go,
which introduced the ability to serialize and deserialize Go types to and from JSON data.
Since then, JSON has become the most popular data format used on the Internet.
It is widely read and written by Go programs,
and encoding/json now ranks as the 5th most imported Go package.Over time, packages evolve with the needs of their users,
and  is no exception. This blog post is about Go 1.25’s new
experimental  and  packages,
which bring long-awaited improvements and fixes.
This post argues for a new major API version,
provides an overview of the new packages,
and explains how you can make use of it.
The experimental packages are not visible by default and
may undergo future API changes.Problems with Overall,  has held up well.
The idea of marshaling and unmarshaling arbitrary Go types
with some default representation in JSON, combined with the ability to
customize the representation, has proven to be highly flexible.
However, in the years since its introduction,
various users have identified numerous shortcomings.There are various behavioral flaws in :Imprecise handling of JSON syntax: Over the years, JSON has seen
increased standardization in order for programs to properly communicate.
Generally, decoders have become stricter at rejecting ambiguous inputs,
to reduce the chance that two implementations will have different
(successful) interpretations of a particular JSON value. currently accepts invalid UTF-8,
whereas the latest Internet Standard (RFC 8259) requires valid UTF-8.
The default behavior should report an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8,
instead of introducing silent data corruption,
which may cause problems downstream. currently accepts objects with duplicate member names.
RFC 8259 does not specify how to handle duplicate names,
so an implementation is free to choose an arbitrary value,
merge the values, discard the values, or report an error.
The presence of a duplicate name results in a JSON value
without a universally agreed upon meaning.
This could be exploited by attackers in security applications
and has been exploited before (as in CVE-2017-12635).
The default behavior should err on the side of safety and reject duplicate names.Leaking nilness of slices and maps: JSON is often used to communicate with
programs using JSON implementations that do not allow  to be unmarshaled
into a data type expected to be a JSON array or object.
Since  marshals a nil slice or map as a JSON ,
this may lead to errors when unmarshaling by other implementations.
A survey
indicated that most Go users prefer that nil slices and maps
are marshaled as an empty JSON array or object by default.Case-insensitive unmarshaling: When unmarshaling, a JSON object member name
is resolved to a Go struct field name using a case-insensitive match.
This is a surprising default, a potential security vulnerability, and a performance limitation.Inconsistent calling of methods: Due to an implementation detail,
 methods declared on a pointer receiver
are inconsistently called by . While regarded as a bug,
this cannot be fixed as too many applications depend on the current behavior.The API of  can be tricky or restrictive:It is difficult to correctly unmarshal from an .
Users often write json.NewDecoder(r).Decode(v),
which fails to reject trailing junk at the end of the input.Options can be set on the  and  types,
but cannot be used with the  and  functions.
Similarly, types implementing the  and  interfaces
cannot make use of the options and there is no way to plumb options down the call stack.
For example, the Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields option loses its effect
when calling a custom  method.The , , and  functions write to a 
instead of something more flexible like a  or .
This limits the usability of those functions.Setting aside internal implementation details,
the public API commits it to certain performance limitations:: The  interface method forces the implementation
to allocate the returned . Also, the semantics require that
 verify that the result is valid JSON
and also to reformat it to match the specified indentation.: The  interface method requires that
a complete JSON value be provided (without any trailing data).
This forces  to parse the JSON value to be unmarshaled
in its entirety to determine where it ends before it can call .
Afterwards, the  method itself must parse the provided JSON value again.: Even though the  and  types operate
on an  or , they buffer the entire JSON value in memory.
The  method for reading individual tokens is allocation-heavy
and there is no corresponding API for writing tokens.Furthermore, if the implementation of a  or  method
recursively calls the  or  function,
then the performance becomes quadratic.Trying to fix  directlyIntroducing a new, incompatible major version of a package is a heavy consideration.
If possible, we should try to fix the existing package.While it is relatively easy to add new features,
it is difficult to change existing features.
Unfortunately, these problems are inherent consequences of the existing API,
making them practically impossible to fix within the Go 1 compatibility promise.We could in principle declare separate names, such as  or ,
but that is tantamount to creating a parallel namespace within the same package.
This leads us to  (henceforth called ),
where we can make these changes within a separate  namespace
in contrast to  (henceforth called ).Planning for The planning for a new major version of  spanned years.
In late 2020, spurred on by the inability to fix issues in the current package,
Daniel Martí (one of the maintainers of ) first drafted his
thoughts on what a hypothetical  package should look like.
Separately, after previous work on the Go API for Protocol Buffers,
Joe Tsai was disapppointed that the  package
needed to use a custom JSON implementation because  was
neither capable of adhering to the stricter JSON standard that the
Protocol Buffer specification required,
nor of efficiently serializing JSON in a streaming manner.Believing a brighter future for JSON was both beneficial and achievable,
Daniel and Joe joined forces to brainstorm on  and
started to build a prototype
(with the initial code being a polished version of the JSON serialization logic from the Go protobuf module).
Over time, a few others (Roger Peppe, Chris Hines, Johan Brandhorst-Satzkorn, and Damien Neil)
joined the effort by providing design review, code review, and regression testing.
Many of the early discussions are publicly available in our
recorded meetings and
meeting notes.The  effort has been going on for 5 years,
incorporating feedback from many contributors and also gaining valuable
empirical experience from use in production settings.It’s worth noting that it’s largely been developed and promoted by people
not employed by Google, demonstrating that the Go project is a collaborative endeavor
with a thriving global community dedicated to improving the Go ecosystem.Building on Before discussing the  API, we first introduce the experimental
 package
that lays the foundation for future improvements to JSON in Go.JSON serialization in Go can be broken down into two primary components: that is concerned with processing JSON based on its grammar, and that defines the relationship between JSON values and Go values.We use the terms “encode” and “decode” to describe syntactic functionality and
the terms “marshal” and “unmarshal” to describe semantic functionality.
We aim to provide a clear distinction between functionality
that is purely concerned with encoding versus that of marshaling.This diagram provides an overview of this separation.
Purple blocks represent types, while blue blocks represent functions or methods.
The direction of the arrows approximately represents the flow of data.
The bottom half of the diagram, implemented by the  package,
contains functionality that is only concerned with syntax,
while the upper half, implemented by the  package,
contains functionality that assigns semantic meaning to syntactic data
handled by the bottom half.The basic API of  is the following:package jsontext

type Encoder struct { ... }
func NewEncoder(io.Writer, ...Options) *Encoder
func (*Encoder) WriteValue(Value) error
func (*Encoder) WriteToken(Token) error

type Decoder struct { ... }
func NewDecoder(io.Reader, ...Options) *Decoder
func (*Decoder) ReadValue() (Value, error)
func (*Decoder) ReadToken() (Token, error)

type Kind byte
type Value []byte
func (Value) Kind() Kind
type Token struct { ... }
func (Token) Kind() Kind
The  package provides functionality for interacting with JSON
at a syntactic level and derives its name from
RFC 8259, section 2
where the grammar for JSON data is literally called .
Since it only interacts with JSON at a syntactic level,
it does not depend on Go reflection.The  and

provide support for encoding and decoding JSON values and tokens.
The constructors
accept variadic options
that affect the particular behavior of encoding and decoding.
Unlike the  and  types declared in ,
the new types in  avoid muddling the distinction between syntax and
semantics and operate in a truly streaming manner.A JSON value is a complete unit of data and is represented in Go as
a named .
It is identical to  in .
A JSON value is syntactically composed of one or more JSON tokens.
A JSON token is represented in Go as the opaque  type
with constructors and accessor methods.
It is analogous to  in 
but is designed represent arbitrary JSON tokens without allocation.To resolve the fundamental performance problems with
the  and  interface methods,
we need an efficient way of encoding and decoding JSON
as a streaming sequence of tokens and values.
In , we introduce the  and  interface methods
that operate on an  or , allowing the methods’ implementations
to process JSON in a purely streaming manner. Thus, the  package need not
be responsible for validating or formatting a JSON value returned by ,
nor would it need to be responsible for determining the boundaries of a JSON value
provided to . These responsibilities belong to the  and .Introducing Building on the  package, we now introduce the experimental
 package.
It is designed to fix the aforementioned problems,
while remaining familiar to users of the  package.
Our goal is that usages of  will operate  the same if directly migrated to .The basic API of  is the following:package json

func Marshal(in any, opts ...Options) (out []byte, err error)
func MarshalWrite(out io.Writer, in any, opts ...Options) error
func MarshalEncode(out *jsontext.Encoder, in any, opts ...Options) error

func Unmarshal(in []byte, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalRead(in io.Reader, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalDecode(in *jsontext.Decoder, out any, opts ...Options) error
The 
and  functions
have a signature similar to , but accept options to configure their behavior.
The 
and  functions
directly operate on an  or ,
avoiding the need to temporarily construct an  or 
just to write or read from such types.
The 
and  functions
operate on a  and  and
is actually the underlying implementation of the previously mentioned functions.
Unlike , options are a first-class argument to each of the marshal and unmarshal functions,
greatly extending the flexibility and configurability of .
There are several options available
in  which are not covered by this article.Type-specified customizationSimilar to ,  allows types to define their own JSON representation
by satisfying particular interfaces.type Marshaler interface {
    MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
}
type MarshalerTo interface {
    MarshalJSONTo(*jsontext.Encoder) error
}

type Unmarshaler interface {
    UnmarshalJSON([]byte) error
}
type UnmarshalerFrom interface {
    UnmarshalJSONFrom(*jsontext.Decoder) error
}
The 
and  interfaces
are identical to those in .
The new 
and  interfaces
allow a type to represent itself as JSON using a  or .
This allows options to be forwarded down the call stack, since options
can be retrieved via the  accessor method on the  or .Caller-specified customizationIn , the caller of  and  can also specify
a custom JSON representation for any arbitrary type,
where caller-specified functions take precedence over type-defined methods
or the default representation for a particular type.func WithMarshalers(*Marshalers) Options

type Marshalers struct { ... }
func MarshalFunc[T any](fn func(T) ([]byte, error)) *Marshalers
func MarshalToFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Encoder, T) error) *Marshalers

func WithUnmarshalers(*Unmarshalers) Options

type Unmarshalers struct { ... }
func UnmarshalFunc[T any](fn func([]byte, T) error) *Unmarshalers
func UnmarshalFromFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Decoder, T) error) *Unmarshalers
While  aims to behave  the same as ,
its behavior has changed in some ways
to address problems in , most notably: reports an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8. reports an error if a JSON object contains a duplicate name. marshals a nil Go slice or Go map as an empty JSON array or JSON object, respectively. unmarshals a JSON object into a Go struct using a
case-sensitive match from the JSON member name to the Go field name. redefines the  tag option to omit a field if it would have
encoded as an “empty” JSON value (which are , , , and ). reports an error when trying to serialize a ,
which currently has no default representation,
but provides options to let the caller decide.For most behavior changes, there is a struct tag option or caller-specified option
that can configure the behavior to operate under  or  semantics,
or even other caller-determined behavior.
See “Migrating to v2” for more information.The  performance of  is roughly at parity with .
Sometimes it is slightly faster, but other times it is slightly slower.
The  performance of  is significantly faster than ,
with benchmarks demonstrating improvements of up to 10x.In order to obtain greater performance gains,
existing implementations of
 and
 should
migrate to also implement
 and
,
so that they can benefit from processing JSON in a purely streaming manner.
For example, recursive parsing of OpenAPI specifications in  methods
significantly hurt performance in a particular service of Kubernetes
(see kubernetes/kube-openapi#315),
while switching to  improved performance by orders of magnitude.Retroactively improving We want to avoid two separate JSON implementations in the Go standard library,
so it is critical that, under the hood,  is implemented in terms of .There are several benefits to this approach:: The  and  functions in  or 
represent a set of default behaviors that operate according to  or  semantics.
Options can be specified that configure  or  to operate with
entirely , mostly  with a some , a mix of  or ,
mostly  with some , or entirely  semantics.
This allows for gradual migration between the default behaviors of the two versions.: As backward-compatible features are added to ,
they will inherently be made available in . For example,  adds
support for several new struct tag options such as  or  and also
support for the  and  interface methods,
which are both more performant and flexible.
When  is implemented in terms of , it will inherit support for these features.: Maintenance of a widely used package demands significant effort.
By having  and  use the same implementation, the maintenance burden is reduced.
In general, a single change will fix bugs, improve performance, or add functionality to both versions.
There is no need to backport a  change with an equivalent  change.While select parts of  may be deprecated over time (supposing  graduates from being an experiment),
the package as a whole will never be deprecated.
Migrating to  will be encouraged, but not required.
The Go project will not drop support for .The newer API in the  and  packages are not visible by default.
To use them, build your code with  set in your environment or with the  build tag.
The nature of an experiment is that the API is unstable and may change in the future.
Though the API is unstable, the implementation is of a high quality and
has been successfully used in production by several major projects.The fact that  is implemented in terms of  means that the underlying implementation of 
is completely different when building under the  experiment.
Without changing any code, you should be able to run your tests
under  and theoretically nothing new should fail:GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go test ./...
The re-implementation of  in terms of  aims to provide identical behavior
within the bounds of the Go 1 compatibility promise,
though some differences might be observable such as the exact wording of error messages.
We encourage you to run your tests under  and
report any regressions on the issue tracker.Becoming an experiment in Go 1.25 is a significant milestone on the road to
formally adopting  and  into the standard library.
However, the purpose of the  experiment is to gain broader experience.
Your feedback will determine our next steps, and the outcome of this experiment,
which may result in anything from abandonment of the effort, to adoption as stable packages of Go 1.26.

Told through never-before-seen accounts and rare archive footage, the film reveals how the Nazi regime clung to power, sacrificing countless lives in a futile bid to delay the inevitable collapse.

It is January 1945 in Germany. The war is lost, but the killing continues. The once mighty Wehrmacht has been driven back on all fronts. In the west, Allied troops are poised to surge into the German heartland.

To the east, the Red Army continues its bloody march towards Berlin. The German war machine is on the brink of total collapse.

This marks a significant milestone, providing a robust and stable way to tune your persistent storage directly within Kubernetes.What is VolumeAttributesClass?At its core, VolumeAttributesClass is a cluster-scoped resource that defines a set of mutable parameters for a volume. Think of it as a "profile" for your storage, allowing cluster administrators to expose different quality-of-service (QoS) levels or performance tiers.Users can then specify a volumeAttributesClassName in their PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to indicate which class of attributes they desire. The magic happens through the Container Storage Interface (CSI): when a PVC referencing a VolumeAttributesClass is updated, the associated CSI driver interacts with the underlying storage system to apply the specified changes to the volume.Dynamically scale performance: Increase IOPS or throughput for a busy database, or reduce it for a less critical application.Optimize costs: Adjust attributes on the fly to match your current needs, avoiding over-provisioning.Simplify operations: Manage volume modifications directly within the Kubernetes API, rather than relying on external tools or manual processes.What is new from Beta to GAThere are two major enhancements from beta.Cancellation support when errors occurTo improve resilience and user experience, the GA release introduces explicit cancel support when a requested volume modification encounters an error. If the underlying storage system or CSI driver indicates that the requested changes cannot be applied (e.g., due to invalid arguments), users can cancel the operation and revert the volume to its previous stable configuration, preventing the volume from being left in an inconsistent state.Quota support based on scopeWhile VolumeAttributesClass doesn't add a new quota type, the Kubernetes control plane can be configured to enforce quotas on PersistentVolumeClaims that reference a specific VolumeAttributesClass.This is achieved by using the  field in a ResourceQuota to target PVCs that have .spec.volumeAttributesClassName set to a particular VolumeAttributesClass name. Please see more details here.Drivers support VolumeAttributesClassAmazon EBS CSI Driver: The AWS EBS CSI driver has robust support for VolumeAttributesClass and allows you to modify parameters like volume type (e.g., gp2 to gp3, io1 to io2), IOPS, and throughput of EBS volumes dynamically.Google Compute Engine (GCE) Persistent Disk CSI Driver (pd.csi.storage.gke.io): This driver also supports dynamic modification of persistent disk attributes, including IOPS and throughput, via VolumeAttributesClass.For any inquiries or specific questions related to VolumeAttributesClass, please reach out to the SIG Storage community.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why AI coding claims don&apos;t add up (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/160</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/160/changelog-news-160.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 8 Sep 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mike Judge breaks down why he doesn’t believe the AI coding claims add up, the folks behind Cactoide create an open source alternative to Meetup / Eventbrite, Ryan Farley tells the story of how RSS beat Microsoft, Dominik Szymański ditched Docker for Podman (and thinks you should too), and Stripe announces a new layer 1 blockchain called Tempo.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

Phoronix explains:


It's become a common occurrence seeing "Link: " tags within Git commits for the Linux kernel that point to the latest Linux kernel mailing list patches of the same patch... Linus Torvalds has had enough and will be more strict against accepting pull requests that have link tags of no value. He commented yesterday on a block pull request that he pulled and then backed out of: 

"And dammit, this commit has that promising 'Link:' argument that I hoped would explain why this pointless commit exists, but AS ALWAYS that link only wasted my time by pointing to the same damn information that was already there. I was hoping that it would point to some oops report or something that would explain why my initial reaction was wrong. 

"Stop this garbage already. Stop adding pointless Link arguments that waste people's time. Add the link if it has *ADDITIONAL* information.... 

"Yes, I'm grumpy. I feel like my main job — really my only job — is to try to make sense of pull requests, and that's why I absolutely detest these things that are automatically added and only make my job harder." 
A longer discussion ensued...


 Torvalds: [A] "perfect" model might be to actually have some kind of automation of "unless there was actual discussion about it". But I feel such a model might be much too complicated, unless somebody *wants* to explore using AI because their job description says "Look for actual useful AI uses". In today's tech world, I assume such job descriptions do exist. Sigh...

 Torvalds: I do think it makes sense for patch series that (a) are more than a small handful of patches and (b) have some real "story" to them (ie a cover letter that actually explains some higher-level issues)...



Torvalds also had two responses to a poster who'd said "IMHO it's better to have a Link and it _potentially_ being useful than not to have it and then need to search around for it."


 Torvalds: No. Really. The issue is "potentially — but very likely not — useful" vs "I HIT THIS TEN+ TIMES EVERY SINGLE F%^& RELEASE". 
There is just no comparison. I have literally *never* found the original submission email to be useful, and I'm tired of the "potentially useful" argument that has nothing to back it up with. It's literally magical thinking of "in some alternate universe, pigs can fly, and that link might be useful"

 Torvalds: And just to clarify: the hurt is real. It's not just the disappointment. It's the wasted effort of following a link and having to then realize that there's nothing useful there. Those links *literally* double the effort for me when I try to be careful about patches... 

The cost is real. The cost is something I've complained about before... Yes, it's literally free to you to add this cost. No, *YOU* don't see the cost, and you think it is helpful. It's not. It's the opposite of helpful. So I want commit messages to be relevant and explain what is going on, and I want them to NOT WASTE MY TIME. 

And I also don't want to ignore links that are actually *useful* and give background information. Is that really too much to ask for?


Torvalds points out he's brought this up four times before — once in 2022.


 Torvalds: I'm a bit frustrated, exactly because this _has_ been going on for years. It's not a new peeve. 

And I don't think we have a good central place for that kind of "don't do this". Yes, there's the maintainer summit, but that's a pretty limited set of people. I guess I could mention it in my release notes, but I don't know who actually reads those either.. So I end up just complaining when I see it.

This summer, a bizarre new trend hit Wall Street: Chinese meme stocks. Promoted in WhatsApp groups, Reddit threads, and even under fake YouTube comments, these obscure Chinese companies soared — and then collapsed — wiping out billions in investor savings. In this video, we explore how Regencell Biosciences briefly reached a $38 billion valuation selling what looks suspiciously like curry ingredients as medicine, we try to understand why the FBI is calling it “ramp and dump” fraud, and how scammers are impersonating brokers, analysts, and even YouTubers to lure in victims.

We’ll compare these knockoff meme stocks to America’s domestically produced meme stock madness — GameStop, AMC, and the DORK stocks — and ask: is this just low-quality IP theft, or a new frontier in financial absurdity?

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, there was a tiny startup.They had only a few customers.So they ran their site using a simple monolith architecture.But one day, their site became extremely popular.So they set up a microservices architecture for scalability.Yet they didn’t know much about API design.And their public APIs often failed from spiky traffic.Also they sent the entire dataset when users asked for just the latest data.Besides it became difficult to manage APIs as they added more features.So they decided to study the best practices to design APIs.Still using a copy-paste website?  is the design-first, no-code website builder that lets anyone ship a production-ready site in minutes. Whether you’re starting with a template or a blank canvas, Framer gives you total creative control—no coding required. Add animations, localize with one click, and collaborate in real-time with your whole team. You can even A/B test and track clicks with built-in analytics.Ready to build a site that looks hand-coded—without hiring a developer? Launch your site for free at Framer dot com, and use code  for a free month on Framer Pro.Best Practices for API DesignHere’s what they learned:REST stands for Representational State Transfer.It's an architectural pattern for systems to talk with each other over the Internet. It helps to organize the data simply and clearly.Think of REST like a book library.There is just one entrance to borrow or return books. While books get organized into different sections by subject.REST APIs organize data into resources similarly.Each data resource gets represented by an API endpoint. For example,  represents a collection of items.While  represents a specific item.The standard HTTP methods allow interaction with the data.: lets you read data from the resource.: lets you add a new item to the resource.: lets you replace an item with newer data.: lets you remove an item from the resource.This approach makes the APIs predictable and easy to interact with.Yet it might be limiting for some real-world actions, such as publishing a draft of a document. So it’s necessary to have a balance between REST principles and a pragmatic approach.A status code tells the client whether a request succeeded or failed.API Error handling means returning clear, consistent error messages if something goes wrong. Thus making it easy for the client to handle the error properly.Imagine you’re at an airport.A bad API error is like the departure board displaying random errors when flight time changes. It doesn’t tell you which flight, why, or what to do next.While a good API error is like displaying the flight name and its reason behind time changes.The response status code tells whether a client error or a server error occurred.And response body includes extra details about what went wrong.Proper error handling in APIs makes a site reliable.Yet it needs extra effort and discipline to handle each failure scenario. Besides error message must include only enough information to avoid security risks.Ready for the next technique?It’s necessary to version an API so new changes don’t break existing clients.Think of API versioning like publishing a new book edition.The old book copies that have already been sold don’t get updated. But the new edition gets released with improvements. So readers who need the updates can get the latest edition. And those using the old one can read it without issues.The API URL path includes the version number.First version → https://app.com/v1/subpathSecond version → https://app.com/v2/subpathThe old version doesn't get updated, while new changes happen on the latest version.Thus ensuring backward compatibility.Here are 2 alternative approaches to implement API versioning:Client includes the version in the Accept header.Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+jsonIt means API version 1 in JSON format.Client includes the version parameter in the URL.https://app.com/subpath?version=1But query parameters are designed for filtering or searching data. So it's better to avoid them for versioning. API versioning makes a site reliable. Yet it increases the complexity and maintenance efforts. So use it only for breaking changes.Rate limiting means controlling the number of requests a client can make to an API within a period. It prevents server overload and protects the API from abuse.Imagine rate limiting as telling a person how many things they can have during a giveaway.The client sends requests to the server through the rate limiter.The rate limiter tracks the number of requests from each client using a counter.The rate limiter rejects a request in case it exceeds the limit.The API includes special HTTP headers in the response about the rate-limiting rules. → total requests allowed. → requests left before being rate-limited. → time when the rate-limiting counter resets.While the API returns a  status code after the client exceeds the limit.Rate limits ensure the high availability of a site. But it’s necessary to set a reasonable rate limit for a better user experience.Besides many people might share the same IP address. So it’s better to rate limit a person using an API key instead of their IP address for accuracy and fairness.API pagination is the technique of breaking a large dataset into smaller chunks. It lets the client request data in smaller parts instead of all at once. Thus achieving low latency and reduced bandwidth usage.Imagine a big book with 1,000 pages. Pagination is like reading through it one page at a time, instead of all at once.There are 2 ways to implement pagination:It’s the most common technique for interacting with a dataset in pages.The server queries the database to find the total number of items and pages.SELECT COUNT (*) AS total
FROM items;The client specifies the page number and the number of items per page in the request.For example, https://app.com/subpath?page=3&limit=20 → skip the first 40 items and return the next 20SELECT *
FROM items
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40;The server responds along with pagination metadata.{
    "data": [{...}],
    "paging": {
        "total": 300,   // total items
        "page": 3,      // current page
        "pages": 15     // total pages
    }
}Offset pagination is simple to understand and easy to implement. Also it lets the client access random pages.But it’s slow with large datasets because the database scans the skipped records as well. Besides there’s a risk of inconsistent results if data gets added or removed during paging.It uses a pointer () to a specific record in the dataset. It means the server returns results after the cursor instead of skipping records.A unique sequential field, such as ID or timestamp, gets chosen as the cursor.The client then includes the cursor parameter in the request.https://app.com/subpath?cursor=abc&limit=20The server fetches the next 20 items after the cursor using the database index.SELECT *
FROM items
WHERE created_at < %cursor
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 21; -- one extra to find the next cursorThe server includes the new cursor as well in the response for future requests.{
    "data": [{...}],
    "next_cursor": "cN315672McETHy"
}Cursor pagination doesn't scan skipped records; instead, it uses the database index. Thus making it efficient for large datasets.Also it gives consistent results even if data gets added or removed during paging. But it’s complex to implement and doesn’t support navigation to a specific page.So choose the pagination technique based on the data size and data update frequency.Ready for the best technique?Idempotency means processing a request only once to avoid unwanted side effects.Imagine paying for something online. And mistakenly getting charged twice for the same transaction.An idempotent API prevents this problem.The client generates a unique string (UUID) to use as the idempotency key.The client includes this key in the HTTP request header.The server processes the request and caches its response.Then it stores the idempotency key on an in-memory database.And the in-memory database gets queried to check if a future request has been processed already.Also the client generates a new UUID whenever the request payload changes. Thus ensuring only new requests get processed.Here are 2 alternative approaches to implement idempotency:Use database constraints, such as unique keys, to prevent duplicates.Use a message queue with built-in deduplication.Idempotency is essential for building reliable APIs. Yet it increases the complexity and operational costs. Besides the idempotency keys should be removed periodically to reduce memory usage. So use it mainly for critical APIs where retries could cause unwanted side effects.API filtering means returning results that match specific conditions in request parameters.The client includes filter parameters in the request URL.https://app.com/subpath?type=valueThe server reads the parameters.Then it queries the database with those conditions.The server returns only the matching records.Filtering improves performance by reducing bandwidth usage. But it increases the complexity of server logic. So use it only if specific data from a large dataset is needed.API sorting means ordering the results by a specific field, using request parameters.The client includes sorting parameters in the request URL.https://app.com/subpath?sort=value&order=ascThe server reads those parameters.It then creates a database query with the ORDER BY clause.The server returns the results sorted by the requested field.Sorting improves usability by ordering data. But it might slow down queries on large datasets without indexes. So use it only if ordering is important.The internet runs using APIs.While good APIs are consistent, predictable, and designed to scale without problems.So it's necessary to have clear documentation, useful error messages, and proper monitoring for APIs.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.

This blog post describes the Pod replacement policy feature and how to use it in your Jobs.About Pod Replacement PolicyBy default, the Job controller immediately recreates Pods as soon as they fail or begin terminating (when they have a deletion timestamp).As a result, while some Pods are terminating, the total number of running Pods for a Job can temporarily exceed the specified parallelism.
For Indexed Jobs, this can even mean multiple Pods running for the same index at the same time.This behavior works fine for many workloads, but it can cause problems in certain cases.For example, popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and
JAX expect exactly one Pod per worker index.
If two Pods run at the same time, you might encounter errors such as:/job:worker/task:4: Duplicate task registration with task_name=/job:worker/replica:0/task:4
Additionally, starting replacement Pods before the old ones fully terminate can lead to:Scheduling delays by kube-scheduler as the nodes remain occupied.Unnecessary cluster scale-ups to accommodate the replacement Pods.Temporary bypassing of quota checks by workload orchestrators like Kueue.With Pod replacement policy, Kubernetes gives you control over when the control plane
replaces terminating Pods, helping you avoid these issues.How Pod Replacement Policy worksThis enhancement means that Jobs in Kubernetes have an optional field .spec.podReplacementPolicy.
You can choose one of two policies: (default): Replaces Pods as soon as they start terminating.: Replaces Pods only after they fully terminate and transition to the  phase.Setting the policy to  ensures that a new Pod is only created after the previous one has completely terminated.For Jobs with a Pod Failure Policy, the default  is , and no other value is allowed.
See Pod Failure Policy to learn more about Pod Failure Policies for Jobs.You can check how many Pods are currently terminating by inspecting the Job’s  field:Here’s a Job example that executes a task two times () in parallel () and
replaces Pods only after they fully terminate (spec.podReplacementPolicy: Failed):If a Pod receives a SIGTERM signal (deletion, eviction, preemption...), it begins terminating.
When the container handles termination gracefully, cleanup may take some time.When the Job starts, we will see two Pods running:Let's delete one of the Pods ().With the  policy, as soon as one Pod () starts terminating, the Job controller immediately creates a new Pod () to replace it.With the  policy, the new Pod () is not created while the old Pod () is terminating.When the terminating Pod has fully transitioned to the  phase, a new Pod is created:As with any Kubernetes feature, multiple people contributed to getting this
done, from testing and filing bugs to reviewing code.As this feature moves to stable after 2 years, we would like to thank the following people:If you are interested in working on new features in the space we recommend

We are excited to announce that as of Kubernetes v1.34, Pressure Stall Information (PSI) Metrics has graduated to Beta.Pressure Stall Information (PSI) is a feature of the Linux kernel (version 4.20 and later)
that provides a canonical way to quantify pressure on infrastructure resources,
in terms of whether demand for a resource exceeds current supply.
It moves beyond simple resource utilization metrics and instead
measures the amount of time that tasks are stalled due to resource contention.
This is a powerful way to identify and diagnose resource bottlenecks that can impact application performance.PSI exposes metrics for CPU, memory, and I/O, categorized as either  or  pressure:The percentage of time that  task is stalled on a resource. This indicates some level of resource contention.The percentage of time that  non-idle tasks are stalled on a resource simultaneously. This indicates a more severe resource bottleneck.These metrics are aggregated over 10-second, 1-minute, and 5-minute rolling windows, providing a comprehensive view of resource pressure over time.PSI metrics in KubernetesWith the  feature gate enabled, the kubelet can now collect PSI metrics from the Linux kernel and expose them through two channels: the Summary API and the  Prometheus endpoint. This allows you to monitor and alert on resource pressure at the node, pod, and container level.The following new metrics are available in Prometheus exposition format via :container_pressure_cpu_stalled_seconds_totalcontainer_pressure_cpu_waiting_seconds_totalcontainer_pressure_memory_stalled_seconds_totalcontainer_pressure_memory_waiting_seconds_totalcontainer_pressure_io_stalled_seconds_totalcontainer_pressure_io_waiting_seconds_totalThese metrics, along with the data from the Summary API, provide a granular view of resource pressure, enabling you to pinpoint the source of performance issues and take corrective action. For example, you can use these metrics to: A steadily increasing  pressure for memory can indicate a memory leak in an application.Optimize resource requests and limits: By understanding the resource pressure of your workloads, you can more accurately tune their resource requests and limits. You can use PSI metrics to trigger autoscaling events, ensuring that your workloads have the resources they need to perform optimally.How to enable PSI metricsTo enable PSI metrics in your Kubernetes cluster, you need to:Ensure your nodes are running a Linux kernel version 4.20 or later and are using cgroup v2.Enable the  feature gate on the kubelet.Once enabled, you can start scraping the  endpoint with your Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution or query the Summary API to collect and visualize the new PSI metrics. Note that PSI is a Linux-kernel feature, so these metrics are not available on Windows nodes. Your cluster can contain a mix of Linux and Windows nodes, and on the Windows nodes the kubelet does not expose PSI metrics.We are excited to bring PSI metrics to the Kubernetes community and look forward to your feedback. As a beta feature, we are actively working on improving and extending this functionality towards a stable GA release. We encourage you to try it out and share your experiences with us.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A pangolin is not what you think</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QEoeOAJqemg</link><author>Real Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/QEoeOAJqemg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 4 Sep 2025 18:00:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC176GAQozKKjhz62H8u9vQQ">Real Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2375 - Tim Dillon</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB8BcRimf78</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uB8BcRimf78?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 4 Sep 2025 17:01:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tim Dillon is a stand-up comic, actor, and host of "The Tim Dillon Show" podcast.

--

Today, credit cards are a $500 billion-a-year industry. Banks consider these lines of credit when deciding whether or not to approve loans, incentivizing customers to maintain multiple credit cards. So, how did this lending system originate? And how did they get to be so popular? Nidhi Upadhyaya digs into the history of credit cards in the United States.

With Mojo, he’s taking another big swing: How do you make the process of getting the full power out of modern GPUs productive and fun? In this episode, Ron and Chris discuss how to design a language that’s easy to use while still providing the level of control required to write state of the art kernels. A key idea is to ask programmers to fully reckon with the details of the hardware, but making that work manageable and shareable via a form of type-safe metaprogramming. The aim is to support both specialization to the computation in question as well as to the hardware platform. “Somebody has to do this work,” Chris says, “if we ever want to get to an ecosystem where one vendor doesn’t control everything.”You can find the transcript for this episode on our website.Some links to topics that came up in the discussion:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>XO Ruby is hitting the road (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/657</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/657/the-changelog-657.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 3 Sep 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jim Remsik has lived on the bleeding edge (but also the heart’s center) of the Ruby world for decades.

by reducing reliance on long-lived credentials.
Following the successful alpha release in Kubernetes v1.33,
Service Account Token Integration for Kubelet Credential Providers
has now graduated to  in Kubernetes v1.34,
bringing us closer to eliminating long-lived image pull secrets from Kubernetes clusters.This enhancement allows credential providers
to use workload-specific service account tokens to obtain registry credentials,
providing a secure, ephemeral alternative to traditional image pull secrets.The beta graduation brings several important changes
that make the feature more robust and production-ready:Breaking change from alpha: The  field is 
in the credential provider configuration when using service account tokens.
This field is new in beta and must be specified to ensure proper caching behavior.Choose between two caching strategies:: Cache credentials per service account token
(use when credential lifetime is tied to the token).
This is useful when the credential provider transforms the service account token into registry credentials
with the same lifetime as the token, or when registries support Kubernetes service account tokens directly.
Note: The kubelet cannot send service account tokens directly to registries;
credential provider plugins are needed to transform tokens into the username/password format expected by registries.: Cache credentials per service account identity
(use when credentials are valid for all pods using the same service account)Isolated image pull credentialsThe beta release provides stronger security isolation for container images
when using service account tokens for image pulls.
It ensures that pods can only access images that were pulled using ServiceAccounts they're authorized to use.
This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive container images
and enables granular access control where different workloads can have different registry permissions
based on their ServiceAccount.When credential providers use service account tokens,
the system tracks ServiceAccount identity (namespace, name, and UID) for each pulled image.
When a pod attempts to use a cached image,
the system verifies that the pod's ServiceAccount matches exactly with the ServiceAccount
that was used to originally pull the image.Administrators can revoke access to previously pulled images
by deleting and recreating the ServiceAccount,
which changes the UID and invalidates cached image access.Credential providers opt into using ServiceAccount tokens
by configuring the  field:At a high level,  coordinates with your credential provider
and the container runtime as follows:When the image is not present locally: checks its credential cache using the configured 
( or )If needed,  requests a ServiceAccount token for the pod's ServiceAccount
and passes it, plus any required annotations, to the credential providerThe provider exchanges that token for registry credentials
and returns them to  caches credentials per the  strategy
and pulls the image with those credentials records the ServiceAccount coordinates (namespace, name, UID)
associated with the pulled image for later authorization checksWhen the image is already present locally: verifies the pod's ServiceAccount coordinates
match the coordinates recorded for the cached imageIf they match exactly, the cached image can be used
without pulling from the registryIf they differ,  performs a fresh pull
using credentials for the new ServiceAccountWith image pull credential verification enabled:Authorization is enforced using the recorded ServiceAccount coordinates,
ensuring pods only use images pulled by a ServiceAccount
they are authorized to useAdministrators can revoke access by deleting and recreating a ServiceAccount;
the UID changes and previously recorded authorization no longer matchesThe beta release builds on service account node audience restriction
(beta since v1.33) to ensure  can only request tokens for authorized audiences.
Administrators configure allowed audiences using RBAC to enable kubelet to request service account tokens for image pulls:Getting started with betaKubernetes v1.34 or later:
KubeletServiceAccountTokenForCredentialProviders=true (beta, enabled by default)Credential provider support:
Update your credential provider to handle ServiceAccount tokensIf you're already using the alpha version,
the migration to beta requires minimal changes::
Update your credential provider configuration to include the required  field:
Choose between  and  cache types based on your provider's behaviorTest audience restrictions:
Ensure your RBAC configuration, or other cluster authorization rules, will properly restrict token audiencesHere's a complete example
for setting up a credential provider with service account tokens
(this example assumes your cluster uses RBAC authorization):For Kubernetes v1.35, we - Kubernetes SIG Auth - expect the feature to stay in beta,
and we will continue to solicit feedback.You can also follow along on the
KEP-4412
to track progress across the coming Kubernetes releases.In this blog post,
I have covered the beta graduation of ServiceAccount token integration
for Kubelet Credential Providers in Kubernetes v1.34.
I discussed the key improvements,
including the required  field
and enhanced integration with Ensure Secret Pull Images.We have been receiving positive feedback from the community during the alpha phase
and would love to hear more as we stabilize this feature for GA.
In particular, we would like feedback from credential provider implementors
as they integrate with the new beta API and caching mechanisms.
Please reach out to us on the #sig-auth-authenticators-dev channel on Kubernetes Slack.If you are interested in getting involved in the development of this feature,
share feedback, or participate in any other ongoing SIG Auth projects,
please reach out on the #sig-auth channel on Kubernetes Slack.You are also welcome to join the bi-weekly SIG Auth meetings,

It defines how our devices (clients) talk to powerful machines (servers) across the internet to fetch data, deliver services, and keep everything running smoothly, often in just milliseconds.In this article, we’ll break down:What exactly Client-Server Architecture isHow the communication between clients and servers actually worksThe different types of client-server modelsThe pros, cons and real-world applications of this architectureClient-server architecture is a computing model in which multiple clients (users or devices) interact with a centralized server to access data, resources, or services.In this model, the  initiates requests (like fetching data or performing an action), while the  handles those requests, manages resources, and responds accordingly, often serving multiple clients at the same time.: The client is typically a device or application that initiates a request to the server. This could be a web browser, a mobile app, or a desktop application.: The server is a powerful computer or software application that processes requests from clients, manages resources, and delivers the requested services or data.: The communication medium (usually the internet) that allows clients and servers to exchange data.Example: Visiting a WebsiteLet’s say you type  in your browser: Browser sends a request to 's web server over HTTP/HTTPS. Finds the HTML, CSS, and JS files and sends them back. Browser displays the page based on those files.How does your browser know what to show when you type in a URL?Or how does your Spotify app pull in your favorite playlist in seconds?It all comes down to how clients and servers talk to each other.Let’s walk through it step by step.The Client Initiates a Request: You (the client) perform an action like clicking a link, pressing “Send” on an email, or opening an app. That action triggers a  to a server.The Request Travels Over the Network: This request usually in the form of an HTTP message is sent over the internet to a server’s IP address. Think of it like mailing a letter to a specific address.The Server Receives and Processes the Request: The server listens on a specific port and handles incoming requests. It processes the data, runs logic, queries a database if needed, and prepares a response.The Server Sends Back a Response: Once processing is done, the server sends the result back. This could be:JSON data for a mobile appThe Client Displays the Response: The client receives the response and renders it on screen. What you see in your browser or app is the result of this back-and-forth.Key Technologies InvolvedHere are some of the technologies that enable this communication:: The most common protocol used by browsers and web servers for communication.: Translates human-friendly domain names (like ) into server IP addresses.: The underlying protocol that ensures data packets are delivered reliably between client and server.: Servers listen on specific ports (like 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS) to accept requests.Client-server systems can vary significantly in complexity based on how many layers (or "tiers") are involved in processing and delivering data.Let’s explore the most common models from the simplest one-tier setup to sophisticated, multi-tiered architectures used in large-scale applications.1-Tier Architecture (Monolithic Model)In , everything—the user interface, business logic, and data storage—resides in a . All operations are handled on the  or within the same application. that store and compute everything locallySimple to build and deployNo network communication overheadNo separation of concernsUnsuitable for multi-user environmentsBest suited for small, standalone, offline applications.In a , the system is split into two parts:The , which handles the  (UI)The , which handles both the  and In a two-tier architecture, the client directly communicates with the server to send requests and receive responses. The server runs the logic and interacts with the database to return results.A  that connects directly to a central database to retrieve and display data.Simple and fast for a small number of usersPoor scalability as more clients are addedPerformance bottlenecks on the serverDifficult to update logic across different clientsSuitable for internal tools or apps with a small user base and limited traffic.The  introduces a dedicated  (also called the ) between the client and the data server.This creates a clear separation of concerns and is the most commonly used architecture for modern web and enterprise applications.Client (Presentation Layer): The front-end interface users interact with (e.g., a browser or mobile app).Application Server (Logic Layer): Processes client requests, applies business rules, and interacts with the database.Database Server (Data Layer): Handles storage, retrieval, and management of data. A web application where the client (browser) interacts with a web server (application server) that then queries a database server to retrieve data.Better scalability and maintainabilityLogic is centralized, so clients are lightweightImproved security and abstractionMore complex than 1- or 2-tier setupsSlightly increased latency if layers aren't optimizedIdeal for web apps, SaaS products, and large internal tools. builds on the 3-tier model by adding  for specific responsibilities such as caching, load balancing, authentication, analytics, or API gateways.Each layer focuses on one concern and communicates only with adjacent layers, enabling high modularity and scalability. User interface or front-end application. Manages the user interface and presentation logic. Handles business logic and rules. Manages data access and storage.Additional Layers (optional): For caching, logging, security, etc. A large e-commerce platform with separate services for user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and payment processing might use an N-tier architecture.Highly scalable and fault-tolerantIndividual layers can be developed, deployed, and scaled independentlySupports complex workflows and distributed teamsMore difficult to design, maintain, and debugHigher latency if not optimizedRequires strong DevOps and monitoring practicesBest for enterprise-grade systems, cloud-native apps, and services that serve millions of users.The client-server model offers several advantages, which is why it’s so widely used: All critical data, resources, and services reside on the server, which means they can be monitored, updated, and secured from a central location. Client-server systems are built to grow. You can  by upgrading server hardware (e.g., adding more RAM or CPU) or  by adding more servers behind load balancers to distribute traffic.Efficient Resource Sharing: One server can serve multiple clients simultaneously, enabling shared access to databases, file storage, and applications. With everything centralized, it’s easier to implement and enforce authentication, authorization, encryption, and access control.Despite its advantages, client-server architecture also has some challenges: If the central server crashes or becomes unavailable, all connected clients lose access. Redundancy, replication and failover mechanisms are needed to mitigate this risk. As the number of clients grows, the server can become overwhelmed, leading to slow response times or system outages. Load balancing, caching and other optimizations are required to maintain performance. As systems grow, managing and scaling a client-server architecture can become complex, requiring advanced infrastructure and expertise.Client-server architecture is ubiquitous in modern computing. You interact with it dozens of times a day, often without even realizing it.Here are a few examples of real-world applications:When you visit a site like , your  sends a request to a , which responds with the HTML, CSS, and content of the page.Email apps like , , or  act as clients that connect to mail servers (using protocols like SMTP, IMAP, or POP3) to send, receive, and sync your emails.Banking apps and websites rely on client-server models to:Display real-time account data all while keeping data encrypted and secure on the server.Cloud providers like , , and  offer on-demand services (compute, storage, databases) using a client-server model. Your apps (clients) communicate with cloud APIs (servers) to scale seamlessly.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.
